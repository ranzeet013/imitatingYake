<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>The heavy glass and bronze door revolved, and
released from its sections, out of the grizzly
November mist and into the rosy and fragrant hotel
lobby, malice and envy, joy and enthusiasm, vanity
and greed. Fear, masked with dignity, wrapped in
sealskin and topped with a charming bright red hat,
came quickly and alone.</p>

<p>Two egg-shaped matrons glanced, lengthened and
set their glances.</p>

<p>Purple-and-henna breathed, “Beautiful wrap.”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you about her in a minute.”
Brown-and-gold spoke from her throat.</p>

<p>Their gazes followed the sealskin down the long strip
of Mosul to the mahogany desk behind which a glossy
clerk suddenly discovered reverence and added it to
his attitude.</p>

<p>“She’s one of the Quilters,” Brown-and-gold informed.
“They are among the best-known families here
in Oregon. They have an enormous ranch over east of
the mountains in Quilter County; half of that country
over there seems to be named for them. They’re
millionaires. Ken says everything they touch turns into
money.</p>

<p>“I’ve never met her—exactly; that’s why I didn’t
speak. But she was at a tea where I was, two years
ago; it was given for the blind. Quilters are supposed to
be very charitable; but why shouldn’t they be? As I
told Ken, a dollar doesn’t mean any more to them than
a thin dime does to us.” She paused to sigh.</p>

<p>“Does she live here at this hotel?”</p>

<p>“No. No—she lives out at the ranch. I can’t imagine
anyone wanting to live away from things, like that.
The ranch is beautiful, though; quite a show place.
Too bad you’re leaving so soon—we might motor over
to see it. Her brother, Neal Quilter, has been stopping
here for a couple of days. I suppose she is here to see
him. I’ve seen him twice lately in the dining room. He
is awfully handsome—a bachelor, too. Will you look
at the bellhop sliding to ring the elevator bell for her?
I’m always allowed to ring it for myself. I hope she has
to wait as long for that elevator as I usually do. The
service here seems to be getting worse and worse; and,
considering the prices they ask——”</p>

<p>“She’s as slim as an old maid. Or is she married?”</p>

<p>“She’s a widow. Judith Quilter Whitefield. Has been,
for years and years. Funny she’s never married again,
with her money. She’s kind of sweet looking yet, don’t
you think? I guess she just didn’t want to marry. I
don’t blame her; why should she? She toured Europe
last year with her sister, Lucy Quilter Cerini, and her
husband——”</p>

<p>“Oh! Is that who she is? I didn’t connect the names
at all. I reviewed one of Lucy Quilter Cerini’s books
for our ladies’ literary society, back home, last year.
I remember I found then that she was born in
Oregon, but I didn’t place her at first. So she’s her
sister?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I’ve never read any of her works. Was the book
you read good?”</p>

<p>“Well—yes. You know she’s very highly spoken
of——”</p>

<p>The elevator door slid open, clinked shut.</p>

<p>Judith looked into the panelled mirror. She was too
pale. She ducked her head and pinched pink into her
cheeks with trembling fingers.</p>

<p>“Fifth floor, madam. To your right.”</p>

<p>Five hundred and two—buckle my shoe. Five hundred
and four—shut the door. Five hundred and——How
slyly, furtively soft these felt-padded carpets
were. They had turned her into a sleuth, creeping,
sneaking up on Neal. She wished that her advent might
have been heralded by at least the smart clicking of
heels. One could not, of course, whistle down hotel
corridors. Perhaps she should have asked the clerk to
telephone. But no, last night and again this morning
she had thought and thought of that, and had rejected
it.</p>

<p>Five hundred and sixteen. She paused, unfastened
her fur collar and set it back from her firm white throat.
She unclasped her handbag, took from it a gold locket
of the sort that dangled from long bead chains in the
eighteen nineties, and snapped it open. In one of its
circles was the picture of an old gentleman with a white,
squarely cut beard, a wide brow, small sensitive
nostrils, and a humorous quirk near the eyes that miraculously
saved the face from the frailty of saintliness. In
the opposite circle, printed in tiny letters, was, Judith
had long thought, a truer portrait of her grandfather.
He had called it a rule of conduct, and had given it to
her during the happiest period of her life: just after
she and Gregory Whitefield had announced their
engagement; months before the suspicion that “Greg’s
bad cold” could be serious.</p>

<p>“Judith Quilter,” the words read. “Achieve
tranquillity.”</p>

<p>Greg had never fully understood. Once, during those
tremulous months in Colorado, when all life’s worth
hung on the slender thread of mercury in the clinical
thermometer, he had asked, when she had opened the
locket: “What’s the magic of it, dear? How does it
make things better for you?”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t,” she had declared. “Not a bit. All it
does is to make me better for things.”</p>

<p>Twenty-eight years ago; and now, still: “Judith
Quilter. Achieve tranquillity.”</p>

<p>She closed the locket, tucked it into the perfumed
silk of her bag, pulled off her glove. At any rate, her
knock should not sound surreptitious.</p>

<p>She snatched her hand from the door and put its
knuckles to her parted lips. “Oh, dear!” she
whispered. How could she have done that? How could she
have produced that insultingly authoritative racket,
which must, because of its very quarrelsomeness, be
met with the rebuke of this smothering silence?</p>

<p>“Judy! You doggone pesty little hound!” The kiss
prickled at the sides, but it was heavily, satisfactorily,
smokily Neal.</p>

<p>“Golly, but you’re pretty, Jude. Been pinching your
cheeks, I’ll bet a dollar——”</p>

<p>“Look, dear. My new hat.”</p>

<p>“Yes, at your age! Running around buying gaudy red
hats and smelling of violets—no, of one violet. Stand
off; let’s have a look at you—you friendly little Jezebel,
you!”</p>

<p>“But, Neal, don’t you like the new hat?”</p>

<p>“Not much. It’s too shockingly becoming. But,
whither, Judy? I thought I left you at home forcing
Lucy’s babies to entertain your guest?”</p>

<p>“I brought Ursula with me, silly. We felt the need
for some shopping so we motored over yesterday evening.
We got in late, and rose rather late this morning.
But there’s been time for the hat, and some toys, and
luncheon. Then I happened to think you might have
tea with us, later; so I’ve run up to ask you.”</p>

<p>“Your naïveté is faultless, darling.”</p>

<p>“Neal! If you have to be a killjoy, you might try to
be a humane one.”</p>

<p>Achieve tranquillity. Do not notice the shadow,
dimming the splendid blondness, the averted eyes, the
contracted shoulders.</p>

<p>“Judith, how did you know that I was here?”</p>

<p>“But, dear, where should you be? You have never
stayed at another hotel in Portland, have you? I felt a
traitor myself. But I did wish to impress Ursula with
the glories of the Trensonian. I think, though, Neal,
that before you left you might have stuck a note on
your pincushion, or——”</p>

<p>“Drop it, Jude. Is Ursula going back to Q 2 with
you?”</p>

<p>“Did she bore you? Was it she who drove you away,
silly?”</p>

<p>“Heavy tact. You know and I know; so, what’s the
use? I’m mad about her. Repellent, isn’t it? A man of
my age. I’m forty-six damn years old.”</p>

<p>“Yes, so you say. But Ursula isn’t a young girl. She
has been a widow for eight years. She loves our West,
and our Q 2, and——”</p>

<p>“You’re as sentimental as a hammock.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care. She does. And she loves you, too, and
has for the past three years. You’d have known it if
you hadn’t been blind. Neal—— What is it?”</p>

<p>Merely a dream: a preposterous dream, about an
absurd play in which a man, who looked like Neal,
went towering, shaking blond fists at his own shoulders;
went muttering, giving an amusingly over-acted
performance of rage. Neal, who was always gentle and
funny and kind, would laugh at such exaggerations and
say, “the cross-patch,” or something of the sort.
Though, if Neal were ill, he might—— Lucy said that
Neal was ill, very ill. Lucy was a genius. She should be
here. Judith was a simple, stupid old woman. Judith
Quilter. Achieve tranquillity.</p>

<p>“Sorry, Neal, if I was inept. Something seems to be
quite the trouble. Perhaps, if you’d care to tell me, I
might understand.”</p>

<p>“Understand?” he accepted the word and seemed
for a moment to caress it. “Understand!” he snarled
it to pieces and flung it back, a shattered brutality.
“Try understanding this, then. And, when you’ve
finished with it, give it to the graceful Ursula, and see
whether she can understand——”</p>

<p>“Neal, dear! Don’t!”</p>

<p>“Don’t! I thought not. You’ve guessed it, of course.
You and Lucy guessed it years ago, together. And now
you tell me—don’t. Don’t tell the truth. Keep my
secret, since I’ve kept it only a lifetime. God, what
I’ve lived through! Sorry. Almost began on that foxy
Spartan stuff. No matter. I’ve kept my mouth shut.
I promised. Or—did I? Sometimes I think my life has
been pinned shut with a promise. Sometimes I think it
has been fear, pride—— Take your choice. I’ve kept
my secret. And I would have kept it if you’d let me
alone. It’s your fault. You brought Ursula. Bent on
your matchmaking mummery. I came away, didn’t I?
Here you are, with Ursula in the offing. Tracking me
down, sneaking—— Sorry. You’re sweet, Judy. But I
tell you, you’ve forced a confidence. You’ve forced me,
and I’m glad of it, into the luxury of a confession. Take
it!</p>

<p>“I killed Father. I did, I tell you. I knew about the
insurance. It seemed the only way out. I fooled them
all. I cut the red mask from Olympe’s satin frock.
I—— Judy, don’t look like that. Put your new hat on. Stop
rumpling your hair. Lovely gray hair you have, Judy. See,
dear, it needn’t matter a lot now—about the murder. We’ll
never tell it—you and I? It needn’t matter at all—except
for Ursula. I can’t marry her. I can’t ever marry,
Jude. That needn’t matter. I’ve never cared a lot about
marrying. Loathed women, mostly. All but you girls,
and—Ursula.</p>

<p>“Think we’d better tell Ursula? Think that’s the
immediate decency required? She’ll run away back to her
Italy, then, and thank her stars she’s well out of this.
She wouldn’t tell on me, do you think? I’d hate being
hanged, you know. All the aspects—personal and
public, is that the way it goes?—of hanging I’d
hate——”</p>

<p>“Neal——”</p>

<p>“Wait, Judy. I want the straight of this. The
low-down on it. Am I mad? Wasn’t that why Lucy had the
psychiatrist visiting at Q 2? No, not what you are
thinking. I committed the murder. I’m guilty—guilty
as a dog. But am I mad? I might well be, having done
in a member of the family. Do you remember, wasn’t
Aunt Gracia a bit mad? All that bunk of her religion—that
Siloamite stuff? We none of us ever admitted it,
of course. And Father—— I wonder whether normal,
sane people ever do kill? What I’m getting at is, there
may be a strain of insanity in the family. Oh, for the
Lord’s sake, Judy, won’t you stop pushing the waves
all out of your hair?”</p>

<p>“Yes, dear, of course. I was trying to think about this
madness. I’m sure that you are mistaken. Aunt Gracia
was a mystic. But you must remember how sane and
wise she was. There may have been something a bit
bleak about her wisdom, but it was deliberate. Father
killed the man exactly as he might have killed a
rattlesnake coiled to strike at Mother. But you, Neal,
forgive me, don’t seem entirely sane to me to-day.”</p>

<p>“Convenient insanity?”</p>

<p>“No, no, Neal. Why be cruel? You suggested it; but
I did say it stupidly. I should have said that you are
quite sane, but that your memory isn’t. The whole
trouble is merely a question of memory. If you will
remember, it is absolutely impossible that you could
have killed Father. I don’t mean morally impossible—that,
too, of course—but physically impossible.
Remember. You were locked in your room at the time.
Within two minutes after the shot was heard, Lucy came
running from her room into yours, through the connecting
door, and found you trying to batter down your
door, that led into the hall, with a chair.”</p>

<p>“Lucy was only a kid at the time. She was much too
frightened to know what she saw.”</p>

<p>“Not at all, Neal. Lucy was twelve, and unusually
precocious.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and I was eighteen, and—unusually precocious.
I tell you, I did it. But I’m not going to tell even you
how I managed it. If the thing should be raked up, and
come to a trial, you wouldn’t wish to know. And, in
the event of a trial, I’d like my little alibi.”</p>

<p>“Dear me, Neal! Really, you are talking now like
a book; a third-rate detective thing.”</p>

<p>“Third rate, nothing of the sort. They are sweeter
than the sex stuff, and a pile more interesting. I’ve been
going in for them lately; and pausing to thank my lucky
stars that we didn’t have a French or a Thorndike at
Q 2 Ranch in 1900. It wouldn’t have taken one of those
birds long to see through seven doors being locked with
ten keys, or the rope from our own attic being swung
out of Father’s window, or Olympe’s being killed the
same way Father was——”</p>

<p>“See, Neal, how false your memory is? Olympe was
not killed that night. She lived for years after that.
Since your memory has begun to play tricks of this sort,
why won’t you trust our memories—my memory? I
know, and all the others know, that there is no
possibility of your having had anything to do with Father’s
murder.”</p>

<p>“You weren’t there, Judy; so, naturally, you’d
remember all about it. Yes, you bet. But that’s what
I want you to know, just the same. You, and the
others. It hasn’t mattered much, until Ursula——”</p>

<p>“Marry Ursula, and it won’t matter then.”</p>

<p>“Chris’s duplex psychology?”</p>

<p>“I suppose so. I’m not clever with it. Come home
with us this afternoon. Tell Chris what you’ve told me.
He’ll straighten it out for you.”</p>

<p>“For me—or for Irene?”</p>

<p>“Shame on you, Neal.”</p>

<p>“Surely. Sorry. But it has always bothered Chris a
lot, you know, having that dapper honour of his sort
of uncreased, as it were, by the fact that Irene was out
straying around loose in the hall that night when the
rest of us were locked up. If you don’t mind, that is, a
lot, I think I’ll ask you not to mention this to
Chris—nor to anyone.”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t have, in any case.”</p>

<p>“Ursula?”</p>

<p>“I think not. Since it is unimportant and false, it
couldn’t interest her particularly. I regard it, rather,
as a wave you’ve done, or had done, to your memory.
You know, exactly like those horrid permanent kinks
that Irene had put in her hair a few years ago. It is
artificial and false and ugly. But, like the hair kinks,
it will grow out straight in time. Until then, the less
attention we call to it the better, I should say.”</p>

<p>“I should say so, too; for that reason, or—another.”</p>

<p>“About going home, dear. We had planned to leave
shortly after tea, have dinner at that delightful new
place on the highway, and spend the night there. Then,
with easy driving, we should be at the ranch in time for
luncheon to-morrow. Would that suit you?”</p>

<p>“On the square, Judy, I am sick of it here. But, if
I go back with you, will you ship Ursula as soon as you
can?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Neal. If that seems fair to you, I will.”</p>

<p>“Damn that red hat, Jude. It is the same colour
that the mask was. I hate red, anyway.”</p>

<p>“Sorry, but I’m afraid you’ll have to endure it.
It cost too much. Will you join us for tea?”</p>

<p>“I think not. Thanks, all that. Did you drive over,
or did you bring George?”</p>

<p>“We brought George. He was so avid to show off
Irene’s conception of a proper uniform for a chauffeur
that I hadn’t the courage to refuse him. He’s a perfect
guy in it, Neal; but as happy as Hallelujah.”</p>

<p>“Fine. I’ll ride in front with him, then. Be sure to
fix it that way, will you, honey?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I will. Shall we come by for you at half-past
five?”</p>

<p>“Wait, Judy, listen. No, I mean really listen. You
remember the snow the night Father was killed? Well,
if anyone from the outside had done it, there’d have
been bound to be footprints——”</p>

<p>“Neal, dear, that was twenty-eight years ago. Need
we go over it all, again, right now? I’ve always believed
that, by the time any of you had regained your senses
enough to look for footprints, the new-falling snow
had covered them.”</p>

<p>“It won’t go, Jude. The snow had stopped before we
heard the shot. We looked within half an hour. The
footprints Chris made, going to the barn, were there plain
as print in the morning. That is—— Weren’t they?”</p>

<p>“So you wrote to me, Neal. In all your letters you
made a particular point of the absence of footprints in
the snow. Do you think you would have written like
that if you’d been trying to hide your own guilt?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I don’t know anything; except that,
sometimes, I think I’ve brooded over this too long.
I admit that I do get hazy about it now. Only——There
is this, Judy. If I didn’t do it, who did?”</p>

<p>“Well, Neal, I believe that is what we are going to
have to find out.”</p>

<p>“Golly, Judy, you’re the prettiest thing I ever saw
when you poke up pert like that.”</p>

<p>“You’d be especially fit to look at yourself, dear, if
you would shave. Half-past five, then? Good-bye.”</p>

<p>No, she could not stop and lean against the wall. She
must walk steadily, oblivious of reeling worlds. She
must keep her chin high; she must point her toes
out—no, straight in front; she had been mistaught about
toes. She must not snatch the hideous, vivid thing from
her head and throw it on the elevator’s floor. She
must———What was that thing? Achieve tranquillity.
But how was that possible? What did tranquillity mean?</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>If the taxicab would stop bouncing her up and down
through the streaming city she could make up her
mind what she must say, or, more important, what
she must not say to Dr. Joe. “We are concerned about
Neal.” No. “Neal, of late, hasn’t seemed quite well.”
No. Neal. Neal. Neal.</p>

<p>The not too tall, very fat man, whose white hair
crowned his pink baldness childishly like a daisy wreath,
took her shivering hands into a grasp that was tight,
and warm, and secure.</p>

<p>She said: “Dr. Joe, I’ve found Neal. I mean—Neal
has been here in the city for the past two days. I
mean—Neal.”</p>

<p>“Sure, I know, Judy. Here, let me help you with that
coat. Too hot in this office for a fur coat. Pretty lining.
That’s a pretty hat, too. Cheerful, but small—that’s
the rule for a hat.”</p>

<p>Ten twirling minutes later he said: “Look, Judy.
What is it you want me to do? I’ll drive over to Q 2 for
the week-end, and only too glad of an excuse. But Neal
will be fit as a fiddle. I guess you know that his trouble
is mental, not physical.”</p>

<p>“But, Dr. Joe, after all, is there a difference?”</p>

<p>“Hello, there! Been taking up Watson?”</p>

<p>“He is so beautifully utilitarian. Sort of in defence,
you know, against Chris’s everlasting Freud, and Jung,
and the rest.”</p>

<p>“Now you let your cousin Christopher alone. He’s
a good boy. He’s getting better all the time. How old is
Chris by now?”</p>

<p>“In his late fifties. He doesn’t look it.”</p>

<p>“He couldn’t. He’s a Quilter. Judy, here’s what I’ve
been thinking. You had that psychiatrist—the Vienna
man—at your place for quite a while last year, didn’t
you?”</p>

<p>“For six weeks. He was a friend of Lucy’s, you know.
But we weren’t positive, then, that anything was really
wrong with Neal. So we wouldn’t allow Dr. Koreth to
hector him. He and Chris had a splendid time together;
but, as far as Neal was concerned, Dr. Koreth’s visit
was useless.”</p>

<p>“You can’t blame him for that, Judy. I couldn’t cut
out a man’s tonsils if I wasn’t allowed to let him know
that anything was the matter with him.”</p>

<p>“I know. But what could we do? Neal’s prejudices
are so strong that he never would have submitted to
an analysis, nor to any treatments along that line.
That is what is going to make it so frightfully difficult
now. I—I——”</p>

<p>“Now, now, now, Judy. Keep a stiff upper lip. There’s
more than one way into the woods—and out of them.
That’s what I’ve learned by being an old mutt of a
general practitioner for forty-five years. We were talking
about a certain Watson just now. Since then I’ve been
thinking of another one—better known. Sherlock
Holmes’s Dr. Watson.</p>

<p>“Look. What I believe is that this murder business
in 1900 has just plum got the best of Neal. He was
eighteen. Adolescence is a tricky time. What I’m
betting is, that if we could find out who did kill Dick,
and prove it to Neal, he would come through with
banners flying. That’s common sense, so I guess it is
good psychology.”</p>

<p>“But——”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know, Judy. But you wait a minute. There’s
a woman down in ’Frisco, and from what I’ve read
about her I think she’s all right. I think she’s a good
woman; a real nice one. She’s a Miss Lynn MacDonald,
and she calls herself a crime analyst. Now suppose we
could get her to come up to Q 2? Lot of us oldsters are
still hanging around who could post her up. Look,
Judy. Neal doesn’t believe in psychoanalysis, but I’ll
bet a cooky he believes in Craig Kennedy. Last time I
saw him, about three months ago, he was down at
Gill’s Bookstore buying mystery by the pound like it
was bacon.</p>

<p>“Why not have her up to the ranch, Judy? Get her
to outline a good case—you know how they do it.
Getting evidence, and piling up proofs from here,
there, and everywhere. Then give the result to Neal.
He’ll be satisfied, and behave himself and get married,
like he should have done twenty years ago, and have
some babies.”</p>

<p>“Father was killed twenty-eight years ago last
month, Dr. Joe.”</p>

<p>“I know it. But, look, how I mean—— In some ways
that will make it easier instead of harder.”</p>

<p>“You mean imaginary proofs to find an imaginary
culprit? No, Dr. Joe, that wouldn’t do. It is difficult to
understand, but most of the time Neal is the keenest
one of the family—the most clear-headed and sensible.
These queernesses of his come on in flashes—and are
gone. Entirely gone. One moment he will be—well, odd.
And, in the next moment, he will be wholly himself
again.”</p>

<p>“No, that isn’t hard to understand, Judy. Most of
them—lots of them are like that. We couldn’t fool Neal
on anything he was sane about. But I think we could
fool him on something he is——”</p>

<p>“Finish it, Dr. Joe. Do you think that Neal is
actually insane?”</p>

<p>“Look, my girl. We can’t say that Neal is sensible
on the subject of Dick’s death, can we? Jehoshaphat,
Judy, I wish we could get him straightened out pretty
quick now! Jehoshaphat, but I do!”</p>

<p>“He’ll not get better, you think, Dr. Joe?”</p>

<p>“Well, look, Judy. You’re asking me. He has been
getting steadily worse for two—almost three—years
now. Of course, you haven’t told me what he said to
you to-day. But I’ve made my living by guessing for
the last forty-odd years. Man ought to be a good
guesser by that time, if he’s ever going to be. So I guess
I know what Neal said to-day that sent you up here
in the condition you were in when you came. That’s
what I’ve been getting at. I want you to bring this
Lynn MacDonald woman up to the ranch, and have
her prove to Neal that he didn’t murder his own
father.”</p>

<p>“He didn’t, Dr. Joe.”</p>

<p>“Bless my soul to glory, Judith Quilter! What are
you telling me that for? Telling me like that, I mean?”</p>

<p>“Dr. Koreth had much to say about a faculty called
empathy. You know—putting one’s self in the place of
another. Identifying, I think he called it. That is what
Neal has done; has overdone. He has put himself in the
place of some other member of the family.”</p>

<p>“Talk’s cheap. You could never make me believe
that. Boy and man, I’ve known the Quilter family for
the last fifty years. Of course, lots of people wouldn’t
agree with me; but, you know, I think I’m a darn good
man. I think I’ve poked along, slow, and done a lot
of good in the world. I think I’ve led a darn decent life.
Most of my goals have been pretty flat, I guess. Most of
my Rubicons—ditches, maybe. But what I’m getting at
is this: The reason I am any good on earth is because
your grandfather, Thaddeus Quilter, took me in hand
when I was a lad. It should begin a biography, or be
put in a preface, or something. ‘I owe——’ You know
how they do it. Well, he was in the house that night.
Do you think that he killed Dick?”</p>

<p>“Dr. Joe!”</p>

<p>“That’s the worst blasphemy I ever uttered, Judith.
I ask the Lord’s and your forgiveness. But, look. Your
Aunt Gracia was there that night. Think that she——”</p>

<p>“Dr. Joe!”</p>

<p>“What did I tell you, Judy? It isn’t right for you to
say what you said. It’s damn wicked for you to think
it. It’s worse than wicked; it’s unhealthy. You’ll be
getting yourself where Neal is. What makes you think
like that, talk like that, my girl?”</p>

<p>“Because—— How well do you remember the
details, Dr. Joe?”</p>

<p>“Well enough. Well enough.”</p>

<p>“Well enough to remember that the ground was
covered with freshly fallen snow, and that no footprints
leading away from the house were found that night,
or later? That Aunt Gracia and Grandfather, with all
the others, searched the house with their thoroughness,
all during the night?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes. I remember that footprint stuff. Fooey,
for your footprints! I’m sorry to say it, Judith, but I
thought better of you than this. The house at Q 2 is
bigger than six barns. Couldn’t some damn scoundrel
have hidden there, before and after, even if those poor
souls, sick with grief and useless from shock and fear
and excitement, did search the house, or try to? I don’t
know what’s got hold of you. But it would take more
than the absence of footprints to make me, an outsider,
doubt a member of your family, or any friend of theirs.”</p>

<p>“It would take more than that to make me doubt,
too, Dr. Joe.”</p>

<p>“You don’t say! Look, Judith, you’re getting me sore.
I’m warning you. By Gad, I wouldn’t let another person
sit there in my chair and say what you’re saying. I’d
slap them over!”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m sure you would, Dr. Joe. But—— No matter.
I think that your suggestion about engaging this
crime analyst is an excellent one. She was the woman
who got to the bottom of that dreadful Hollywood
affair, wasn’t she? I remember the name. Only—I’ll
want the truth from her. Neal, mentally disabled, is
so much keener than most mentally sound people that
he’d reject a falsity. I know it.”</p>

<p>“Like you said just now, Judy, it was all over
twenty-eight years ago. Look, we couldn’t go to
anybody—not to Sherlock Holmes himself—and say,
‘There was a murder on the Q 2 Ranch back in 1900.
Some few oldsters are living yet who were around at
the time and could tell you something about it—what
they can remember. The house is still there, though
it has been remodelled and refurnished a couple of times.
A good many people studied over the case in 1900, but
they all had to give it up. People have been studying
over it ever since, for that matter; but they can’t get
any place with it at all. What we want from you, now,
is for you to get the thing straightened out as soon
as possible, and produce, or anyway name, the guilty
wretch or wretches.’ ”</p>

<p>“Dr. Joe, Greg and I went to Colorado in March,
1900. Lucy, with her passion for writing, wrote long
letters to me until late September. Father was killed
on the eighth of October. On the tenth of October, Neal
took up the letter writing. (I couldn’t leave Greg alone,
and, of course, I couldn’t bring him home to the
horror there.)”</p>

<p>“I should say you couldn’t. You were a good wife,
Judy. Greg was a fine, true husband. But you should
have married again—had babies.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps. About the letters, Dr. Joe. I have read and
reread them. To me they seem tremendously significant.
Significant, maybe, by omission; but significant,
nevertheless. This is particularly true of Lucy’s letters.
Queer things, very queer things began to happen at
Q 2 long before Father was killed. The family
discord—— But I won’t go into that. There were other
things. The accident, in which Father narrowly escaped
with his life. The absurdity of his baptism——”</p>

<p>“How old was Lucy when she was writing you all
this truck?”</p>

<p>“She was twelve years old. Yes, I know—but you
must remember that Lucy was a genius, even then. Dr.
Koreth said, one evening, that modern criminologists
are coming to value the accuracy of children’s
testimony. From Lucy I may well have what may have been
the motivating factor, or factors. From Neal, with a
man’s intelligence and a boy’s honesty and eagerness,
I have the results. A day-by-day account, for several
weeks, of all the findings, the suspicions, the theories,
and—well, the clues.</p>

<p>“Like Lucy and Chris, Neal was a born scribbler.
He never had time to give to it, but he loved even
the physical act of writing. He began his letters to
me with the avowal that he was writing them in order
that I might, with the facts placed before me, help him
to discover Father’s murderer. He thought it was the
truth. But the letters show that his real reason for
writing to me was to have an outlet for the stuff that
was torturing his mind. What I am trying to say, Dr.
Joe, and am saying so stupidly, is that Neal gave me,
unconsciously, more than a bare recountal of facts.
It seems possible, at least, that a mind trained in
criminal analysis could take these letters, and Lucy’s,
and read the truth from them. I can’t decipher the most
simple code. But the Rosetta stone has been
deciphered.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t the other folks write you letters during that
time, too?”</p>

<p>“None that I kept. They were all troubled at home,
and their letters weren’t like them. I kept Lucy’s
because—well, because they were Lucy’s, I suppose.
At the time, it seemed more loyal to destroy the
others. Then, after Father’s death, none of them told
me the truth—so I destroyed them. But I have Lucy’s,
and I have Neal’s. Three hours ago I wouldn’t have
given them to a stranger—no, not to a friend—to read
for anything in the world. But now——”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe you need to, Judy. Look. If we,
backed up by this crime analyst, could make believe
that something was the truth—why wouldn’t that do?
No, you won’t have it? Well, look, I’m going to have
to be pretty mean. I’m going to have to tell you that I
think that will be the best we can do. I don’t believe
anybody, trained analyst or not, could get at the fact
of Dick’s murder at this late date; not from a packet
of letters, twenty-eight years old, written by a couple
of kids.”</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t diagnose the simplest case without
seeing the patient. Those letters are here in my
safety-deposit vault at the bank. I’m going now and get them
and bring them to you. Will you read them? And will
you come to Q 2 over the week-end, and tell me what
you think of them? I’d come to the city, but I don’t
like to leave Neal——”</p>

<p>“Look, Judy. I’d read the complete works of Ouida
if you asked me to, and you know it. I’ve been dying
to come to the ranch all fall. I’ve been kind of bashful,
though, hanging back and waiting for an invitation.
There, there, never mind about that. Run along, and
be a good girl. You’ll have to hop to it to make the
bank before three——”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Dr. Joe. Thank you, and——”</p>

<p>“You run along now, like I told you, or I’ll send you
a bill!”</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>Judith watched the fire twisting around the oak
logs in the living-room fireplace and wondered why Dr.
Joe had created a niece for himself since she had seen
him in his office last Wednesday.</p>

<p>Irene, faultlessly blonde, buoyantly obtuse, appeared
in the doorway, shook an arch forefinger, chirped, “Oh,
you two——” and disappeared.</p>

<p>Dr. Joseph Elm said: “Her legs are too fat. She ought
to wear longer skirts. Old lady like her. But, as I was
saying, Judy, this niece of mine has been fussing and
fussing—you know how it is—to have me come down
to ’Frisco to see her. Look, I think I’ll go down
to-morrow or the next day; and, while I’m there, I might
just as well hunt up this Miss MacDonald. Save you
a trip down. You can post me up on what to say——”</p>

<p>“You’ve read the letters, Dr. Joe. What do you think
of them?”</p>

<p>“Well, now, Judy—I hardly know.”</p>

<p>“But honestly, Dr. Joe?”</p>

<p>“Judy, since you want it, I believe that somebody
real smart might get something or other out of the
letters. They give a lot of facts, and they seem to give
them pretty straight.”</p>

<p>“You think, as I think, Dr. Joe, that it must have
been one of us?”</p>

<p>“Bless my soul to glory, if I do! Look, Judy. It does
seem like whoever did it must have been in the house
before—and quite a while afterward. But those were
the days of lamps and candles out here on the ranch.
Somebody might have hidden in the house for a couple
of days—cellar, attic. Anyway, look! What’s the sense
of amateurs like us tinkering around and worrying over
this thing when we can get a professional, a specialist,
to take it in hand? I don’t examine a man’s teeth; I
send him to his dentist. Since I’m going to be in ’Frisco
anyway, I might as well stop in and make a dicker with
this crime analyst. I’ve been thinking. It might be a
good plan to fetch her right up here. She could get the
lay of the land then. And while she was studying over
the letters she could talk to you and Lucy, and you could
answer any questions for her. What do you think?”</p>

<p>“I’d agree, except for Neal. He has been himself
since we came home on Thursday. But I am afraid that
it wouldn’t do to have him know we were delving into
the thing again. I’m sure it wouldn’t be safe. I fancy,
though, considering her profession, that this woman
would be willing to come as a friend of Lucy’s, or
as—your niece.”</p>

<p>“Or as a hired girl, something along that line?”</p>

<p>“It would be much easier to explain a guest at Q 2
than it would be to explain a new servant, after all
these years of Tilda, and Lily, and George, and Gee
Sing.”</p>

<p>“Look, Judy. I’ll size her up. If she’s ornery ordinary,
I’ll wire you, and you’ll have to sandwich her in as help
for Tilda or something. If she’s just common ordinary,
the niece racket would be all right. And if she should
happen to be extraordinary, we’ll work the friend of
Lucy’s stunt.</p>

<p>“Never mind. I’ll take it you’ve said it, and thanks.
Look, Judy, you don’t need to compliment my
relatives, though, because I’m going to be pretty mean
about one of yours right now. Irene’s a doggone chatterbox.
And, like most of that kind, she isn’t smart enough
to show, either. Seems to me it would be better not to
let Irene in on this. I don’t mean that she’s malicious.
But she’d spill the beans, sure as fate, some place
where Neal would find them.”</p>

<p>“I know. But I’m afraid Chris would resent it if we
didn’t tell her.”</p>

<p>“Look. There’s no law been passed that we have
to tell Chris, either. Did you mean to go tearing the lace
off your silly handkerchief, Judy?”</p>

<p>She dropped the nervous fluff into her lap. “This is
going to be hard to carry through, Dr. Joe.”</p>

<p>“You’re right. It is going to be hard. Hard as blazes.
Are you sure you want to, my girl?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t any choice.”</p>

<p>“I hate to say this, Judy; but you know there is a
chance, or half a chance that you, or even Neal, might
be partly right about this: that some one of the
family——”</p>

<p>“I know. That’s why I think we should tell Chris the
truth about this woman, if she comes here. You see,
Lucy and I will know who she is.”</p>

<p>“Lucy was a kid. You were in Colorado. Look, Judy.
Chris is a good boy, and he’s getting better all the
time. But he’s been married to Irene for twenty-odd
years—and, bless my soul to glory, he’s been in love
with her all the while, and is yet. Tell Chris, and you’ve
told Irene.”</p>

<p>“I suppose so.”</p>

<p>“Here’s another thing. If there can be anything
comparative about one Quilter’s feelings for another
Quilter, I’d say that Neal and Chris were less partial
to each other than any other members of the family.
It would bust Chris all up to have Neal get worse. But
he’d have that happen even before he’d haul what he
calls the Quilter honour down from the flagstaff where
he keeps it hoisted.”</p>

<p>“I’m not sure; but I believe that isn’t fair to Chris.”</p>

<p>“You bet it is. Look, Judy. It is a matter of taste
whether you’d rather have one cousin wind up in a
nice, comfortable sanitarium somewhere, or whether
you’d rather have it proved that your aunt, or your
uncle (by Jolly, Judy, Phineas was a great old boy,
wasn’t he! Letters seemed to bring him right back to
me), or another cousin, or—yourself, or your wife,
maybe, killed a member of the family. I’m for you,
Judy. I’m with you to the finish. Always have been.
I’m in love with you, you know. If I wasn’t, I’d send
you a bill. But yet you can’t blame Chris for the stand
he’d be bound to take, either.”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Want to change your mind, my girl? We could drop
this thing right here, flat as a pancake.”</p>

<p>“Neal is my little brother. I mean—— Well, when
I was seven years old, Neal was three. He had fat little
legs, and he followed me about wherever I went. I
mean—I always did take good care of him. He knew
I would. Forgive me, Dr. Joe. I’m naturally
sentimental; but you and Neal seem to be the only people
who tempt me to display it. All I was trying to say was
that I have determined to go through with this.
And—I wish I could think of some way to thank you. It
seemed almost impossible for either Lucy or me to
go to San Francisco just now.”</p>

<p>“Going to ’Frisco anyhow. Funny fellow if I couldn’t
do a little neighbourly errand for a friend.”</p>

<p>“I understand about the trip, and the niece.”</p>

<p>“Judy, you’re flirting with me. Shame on you—an
old lady like you!”</p>

<p>“I’m not. I’m adoring you.”</p>

<p>“You’re darn right. You’d better, or I’d send you a
bill.”</p>

<p>“Do you think this crime analyst will come up to
Q 2, Dr. Joe?”</p>

<p>“Come? She’ll jump at the chance.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>Dr. Joseph Elm said: “Look, Miss MacDonald,
I’m not asking you to say whether or not you’ll
take the case. All I’m asking you to do is to read these
letters.”</p>

<p>“Letters,” Lynn MacDonald explained, “that pertain
to a murder committed twenty-eight years ago.
Many of them, you have told me, written by a twelve-year-old
child. Yes, I admit the fact that the child was
Lucy Quilter does make some difference—but not
enough. The remainder written by a boy who since has
confessed to the murder. At the very best, I could
form a theory or two. Any possibility of proving those
theories has been removed by time. I am sorry, Dr.
Elm, but——”</p>

<p>“Will you read these letters, just read them, I mean,
for five hundred dollars?”</p>

<p>“My time——”</p>

<p>“Yes. I know about time. Everybody’s time. Will
you read them for a thousand dollars?”</p>

<p>“I am not a highway robber, Dr. Elm.”</p>

<p>“No? Well, bless my soul to glory if I know what
you are. You’re a darn good crime analyst, or so I hear.
But if you’re not a better analyst than you are a
woman, you’ve nothing to show. Look. As a woman,
you’re a mess. You haven’t any kindness, or patience,
or sympathy—not even pity. You haven’t any
courage—afraid to take a chance. You haven’t much of
anything but lack of time.”</p>

<p>He settled back patiently in his chair. If he had
guessed rightly about that red hair and those clear
gray eyes, something was going to happen in half a
minute now.</p>

<p>Lynn MacDonald stood, tall, behind her desk.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you are right,” she said. “Certainly you are
right about my lack of time. I have no time to sit here
and listen to insults from importunate strangers.”</p>

<p>Dr. Elm added to his patience an air of solid
permanence.</p>

<p>“Funny thing,” he offered, “about women. Tell
them the truth and ninety-nine out of a hundred will
think you are insulting them. I kind of figured, maybe
you’d be the hundredth. But I see now where I made
my mistake. I should have tried to wheedle instead
of——”</p>

<p>“Bullying,” supplied Miss MacDonald.</p>

<p>“All right. Look. I’ve found out one thing you’ve
got—that’s a temper. Glad to see it. Makes you a person.
You’re Scotch-Irish, I judge. Best debtors in the world.
Never had a Scotch-Irish bill yet that wasn’t paid.
Look. You won’t read those letters for love or money.
Will you read them to pay a debt?</p>

<p>“Hold on. Let me tell you. I’m a professional man,
same as you’re a professional woman. I’ve got a consulting
room, too. It isn’t near as stylish as this one of
yours. One thing, I’ve had it forty-odd years, and it’s
kind of worn down some, and rubbed off. Another
thing, I don’t much favour elegant consulting rooms.
Patients likely to get impressed. ’Tisn’t a good thing
to impress your patients. Many a stomachache has
turned into appendicitis just from the patient being
ashamed to own up to an ordinary stomach ache in the
midst of walnut furniture and Persian rugs. Look.
Here’s what I’m getting to.</p>

<p>“I’ve been sitting up there, afternoons, for the past
forty years. I’ve had time and patience, all that while,
to listen to women—two thirds of them nervous, hysterical
things, poor souls—telling me about their backaches,
and their numb spells, and their throbbing heads.
Until the last ten years or so about all I could do was
to listen, and then pat them on the shoulders, and tell
them they were fine, brave girls, and give them some
healthy advice, and send them home. About all I can
do yet, for that matter. Say psychiatrist to most women
and they’ll up and act like you did just now when I was
trying to tell you something. No. I sit and cluck, like
an old hen eating, and listen. I suppose the time I’ve
wasted listening to and pitying your sister-women
would aggregate about twenty years. Money doesn’t
pay for it—if I got paid with money, which I generally
don’t, because I can’t cure them. Thanks might pay,
but I’ve never got thanked—much. (‘Old Dr. Elm
simply could not find what my trouble was. So I went
to young Dr. Sawbones, and he cut it right out. I
wouldn’t have lived three months without the operation.’)
But I’ve kept along. I’ll go back, when I leave
here, and sit up there and listen, and cluck, till I die.
But I’ve always kind of thought, maybe, sometime I’d
get paid back. I’ve never asked a favour of a woman
in my life, Miss MacDonald. Never even asked a girl
to marry me. Well, I’m asking a favour now. You can
read these letters in less than the time you could read
a novel. How about it? A couple of evenings, as pay for
twenty years? And if you tell me there’s no reason why
you should pay for all the time I’ve given to your
sister-women, I’ll tell you that, come to it, there generally
isn’t a reason for most of the fine, grand things folks
have done. Florence Nightingale, Father Damien,
or——”</p>

<p>Lynn MacDonald, sitting behind her desk, resting
her chin on her bridging fingers, smiled. “Or,” she
questioned, “Dr. Joseph Elm?”</p>

<p>“I get you. It’s below the belt, all the same.”</p>

<p>“But, no, you didn’t ‘get’ me. I meant, any real
reason for him to come here and offer me what he has
just offered me. Oh, yes. I know what it is. In spite of
your opinion of me, I have some of it myself—in payment
for a service, not for himself, but for friends of
his?”</p>

<p>“Well, of course, if it comes to that, the Quilters have
always seemed a lot more like relations than friends.”</p>

<p>“I see. Now, then, Dr. Elm, since I am to read the
letters, perhaps if you could give me just the outlines
of the case? None of the details, but facts enough to
allow me to study the letters with some understanding
from the beginning?”</p>

<p>“Yes, you bet. That’s what I thought, too. If we
could kind of whittle through the thing together, before
you began on the letters, it might save you a lot of
time.”</p>

<p>Miss MacDonald’s pink palms met meekly in her
lap. Her face was quiet, but the comprehension in her
gray eyes was visible.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>“Here,” said Dr. Elm, “we are.” He produced a
derelict notebook from his pocket, and flicked through
it with a dampened forefinger. “Yes. I’ve made out a
list of characters—like in a play——”</p>

<p>“First, if you will,” suggested Miss MacDonald,
“I’d rather hear, again, the outlines of the case. Where
the murder was done, when, and how. Later, perhaps,
the people who were on the premises at the time would
be helpful. I have understood you to say that Richard
Quilter was shot when he was in bed in his room at
night. That the absence of a weapon precluded all
possibilities of suicide. That a rope was found hanging from
his window, out across a porch roof beneath the window,
and to the ground. That the freshly fallen snow on the
roof and the rope indicated that the rope had not been
used as a means for escape. That careful searching of
the grounds that night, particularly in front of each
window and door, seemed to prove that no one had left
the house after the shot was heard.”</p>

<p>“That’s right, so far; exactly right. Now let me see.
Yes, here it is. The time was Monday around midnight,
on the eighth of October, in the year 1900. The place
was the Quilters’ big cattle ranch, Q 2 Ranch, in Quilter
County, eastern Oregon.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” suggested Miss MacDonald, with a last
clutch at her dinner engagement, “if you have it all
written in the notebook, you might leave it, with the
letters?”</p>

<p>Dr. Elm squeezed the book shut and sunk it into his
pocket. “You couldn’t,” he explained, “make heads or
tails of that. Let me see. Where was I?</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. On Monday night, October the eighth, the
Quilter family went to bed early, as usual. Irene Quilter,
the young bride of Christopher Quilter (Chris was
Richard’s—Dick’s—cousin) couldn’t sleep, so she got
up about ten o’clock, put on her slippers and her
wrapper, took a candle and went downstairs to the sitting
room. She lighted the hanging lamp down there, and
poked up the fire, and read until a little after eleven
o’clock. Then she went back upstairs. When she tried
to go into her room and Chris’s, she found that the door
was locked.</p>

<p>“Now Irene, like most people who haven’t much pride,
was awfully precious with what she did have. She was
too proud to knock. Also, it made her mad all over to
think Chris had locked her out. She turned around
and sneaked straight downstairs again, and fixed herself
a bed, with Indian blankets, on the sofa in the sitting
room.</p>

<p>“I judge that the more she thought about it the madder
she got. You see, she and Chris had had a little tiff
before he went to sleep. She decided that Chris would
be ashamed of himself pretty soon—as he would have
been, sure enough, if he’d played such a mean trick on
his wife—and come downstairs to find her and to try to
make it up. So what does she do but bolt the door to
the back stairway—it came down into the sitting
room—and go into the front hall and bolt the door to the
front stairway. (It comes out in the letters how the
Quilters were never much for locking doors. But they
had to have bolts on these stairway doors so that they
wouldn’t blow open and bang in the winter, when they
tried to keep the upstairs shut off.) Locking Chris
out—showing him two could play at that lock-out game,
as she put it—made Irene feel enough better so that she
cozied right up in her sofa bed to cry, but, by mistake,
she dropped off to sleep. The next thing she knew she
heard a revolver shot upstairs. It sounded, everybody
said, like a cannon in the quiet of the place.</p>

<p>“She jumped up, lighted her candle, got into her
wrapper and slippers, and ran upstairs. When she
reached the upper hall, she must have thought
everybody had gone crazy, for they were all pounding on
their doors, on the inside, and shaking them, and
shouting. They were, like I told you a while ago, all
locked in their rooms. She ran down the hall toward
Chris’s and her room. When she came to Dick’s room
she saw that the door was open and a lamp was lighted
in there, so she ran in. She found Dick in bed, shot
though the left chest.</p>

<p>“She ran to him. The window was wide open. That
wasn’t the custom in those days—three inches down
from the top—and she said he turned his eyes toward
the open window and muttered something that sounded
like ‘Got away.’ At first Irene was sure he had said ‘Got
away.’ Later, when folks quizzed her, she admitted
that he might have said, ‘Go away.’ But his next words,
she declared up and down, were, ‘Red mask.’</p>

<p>“She kind of lifted him up—worst thing in the world
to do, of course, but Irene was an awfully stupid
woman—and then he said the names of his three
children: ‘Neal, Judith, Lucy.’ It was then, Irene said,
when she was stooping over him, that she got blood on
the front of her wrapper and on her sleeve.</p>

<p>“She thought he wanted the children brought to him;
but she didn’t like to leave him, and she didn’t know
what to do. She had it firmly fixed in her mind, in spite
of what he had tried to say when he glanced toward
the window, that he had shot himself; so she never
thought of asking him even one question. She wouldn’t.
Well, anyway, she finally started to go for Neal and
Lucy—Judith wasn’t at home—and he spoke out again
and said, ‘Wait, Father.’ He meant his own father,
Thaddeus Quilter.</p>

<p>“Irene went back to Dick and he said, clearer this
time, putting all his strength into it, ‘Bring Father. I
must tell him.’ He repeated, ‘Must tell Father,’ and
that was the end.</p>

<p>“Sometime, during all of this, it had dawned on her
what the trouble in the hall was. I mean, that the family
were all locked in their rooms. Right there on Dick’s
bedside table, under his lamp, she saw a scatter of keys.
She put them in her wrapper pocket and ran out and
unlocked the doors. All the locks upstairs were the
same; otherwise Irene never would have got the keys
sorted out and the doors unlocked, I guess. Lucy’s door
was opposite Dick’s, so Irene unlocked it first. Neal was
in Lucy’s room. They ran across the hall—Irene had
said, ‘Your father,’ to them—but it was too late. Dick
was dead when Lucy reached him. That’s the story,
as briefly as I can tell it.”</p>

<p>“He lived and was conscious for some few minutes
after he was shot. How about the position of the bed?
Would there have been any possibility that he could
have thrown the revolver from him, through the open
window?”</p>

<p>“Look. The bed was ten or twelve feet from the
window. The gun would have had to land on the porch
roof, just beneath the window. The snow on the roof
was unbroken. There was nothing on it, or in it, except
the rope. The only other gun in the room was on the
top shelf of a closet, the length of the room, at least
twenty feet, from the bed. It was found fully loaded.
Now about the rope——”</p>

<p>“Forgive me, Dr. Elm. You got your details from the
letters, didn’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Of course I’d heard a lot of talk at the time. I
got to Q 2 as fast as I could after they sent me word. I
got there early Wednesday morning. But I’d forgotten
some, and most of the details I never had any too
straight, anyway. I was too busy looking after the
family to take the interest I should have, maybe.
Anyhow, what I really thought, in spite of heck and high
water, was that some dirty cur had got into the house
and killed the boy and got out again—some way or
other. It was what I wanted to believe, so I’ve kept at
believing it until—here recently.”</p>

<p>“These letters, nothing else, have forced you to
change your mind?”</p>

<p>“That’s about the size of it, I guess.”</p>

<p>“The letters, that is, which recount all the findings of
the murder, and which were written by the person who
has since confessed to it?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Neal wrote them, thank the Lord. If he hadn’t
written these letters when he was eighteen, it might be
a lot harder for us now when he is forty-six.”</p>

<p>“I see. Now, then, if you will, tell me about the people
who were in the house at the time. Then, when I begin
to read the letters, I can recognize the members of the
family, and the others, in their proper relationships.”</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>Dr. Elm said: “Miss MacDonald, I’ve never won
any fame for driving a hard bargain, and I don’t care
about starting to this late in life. You’ve agreed to read
the letters; nothing else. If you say the word, I’ll begin
right here with descriptions of the family. But, look;
you mentioned relationships. There’s another relationship
that is mighty important. I mean the relationship
of the Quilter family, for the past two hundred and some
years, to their environment. You can’t snatch a parcel
of folks away from their backgrounds and then account
for the way the folks act. People live in a pattern.
Whether the pattern is entirely of their own formation,
or whether it isn’t, hasn’t much of anything to do with
it. The pattern is there—just as sure as it is here in this
pretty rug of yours. And, to see folks honestly, you have
to see them with relation to their pattern. This is so
true that, if you haven’t their right pattern, you’ll
give them another. That’s why I quarrel with the
Behaviourists.</p>

<p>“Now as soon as you begin to read Lucy’s letters
you’ll begin to wonder. They don’t sound like the letters
of a little back-country ranch girl. And Neal’s don’t
sound like the letters of a country bumpkin, nor yet of a
buckaroo in eastern Oregon in 1900. From start to
finish of these letters, you’ll be bothered finding the
original Quilter pattern. I can give it to you in five
minutes, if you’ll let me. Will you?”</p>

<p>“But,” began Miss MacDonald, and amended a
quick, “of course.” She refused herself a glance at her
wrist watch and repeated, by way of improvement,
“But of course.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, in 1624 James the First made a big land
grant in Virginia to Sir Christopher Quilter—tenth
great grandfather, the children call him. You know your
American history well enough to know that the fact
that Sir Christopher and his wife Delidah stayed right
there and succeeded in laying the foundations for a
great family estate means something. I could spend all
afternoon telling you Quilter history, but I won’t.
Right from then on it is a history of decent, striving,
successful men and women, with heroes scattered thick
as fleas on a dog’s back. One of the Quilters was a warm
personal friend of Washington’s—so on.</p>

<p>“In 1848 the original grant, or most of it, was still
owned by a Christopher Quilter. He had three sons:
Christopher, Thaddeus, and Phineas. When Christopher
and Thaddeus had come of age, the old man had given
them free leases on plantations of their own—slaves and
all. These two lads had been educated at Oxford. That
gave them a chance, maybe, to get a perspective on the
question of slavery.</p>

<p>“Christopher, the eldest son, was thirty years old in
1848. Thaddeus, the second son, was twenty-eight
years old. Phineas, the youngest, was fifteen. He was in
England. Well, the two older boys put their heads
together and decided to leave the South. They hated
slavery, like most decent men did. Also, they hated
the sectional differences; and being as smart as some
and smarter than most, both of them saw pretty well
what was going to happen in the nation, sooner or
later.</p>

<p>“They talked it over with their father, of course, and
he agreed with them, right down to the ground. He was
less of an abolitionist, maybe, than his sons were. But
he thought that the South would secede and get away
with it—and he hated the idea worse than poison.
He’d have come with the boys to the Oregon territory, I
think, but for the question of the slaves on the
plantation.</p>

<p>“Maybe you’ve heard about fine, grand abolitionists
in the South who freed their slaves and went North?
Yes. Look, maybe you’ve heard, too, about people who
moved and left their cats, free as air, to starve. Decent
Southerners, in those days, didn’t free their slaves and
walk off. No more than a decent father, nowadays, frees
his children and walks off.</p>

<p>“No, siree. Great-grandfather Quilter sold the two
plantations that his sons had been managing, and gave
them the money he got for them. Christopher and
Thaddeus took the money, and their wives, and came
out to Oregon in 1848. Great-grandfather stayed in
Virginia, and took care of the slaves until he died, during
the last year of the Civil War.</p>

<p>“Sure, Christopher and Thaddeus came as wealthy
men. But I don’t need to tell you that they gave up
lives of luxury and ease for the hardships of pioneering.
They had two reasons. I don’t know which loomed
larger to them. One was to get clear shed of the wickedness
of slavery. The second was to found another family
estate in a safe land. Phineas and Thaddeus both
fought on the side of the North during the war. When
the war was over, they came home to the Q 2 Ranch.
And there they’ve lived and raised their families; and
there their children and their children’s children are
living up to now, 1928. Pretty decent-looking pattern?
Nearly as I can judge it’s made of material that hasn’t
any wrong side to it, nor any seams. That is, until this
cussed murder business ripped through it in 1900.</p>

<p>“Christopher, the eldest brother, and his wife had
both died by that time, and Thaddeus Quilter was the
head of the family. He was eighty years old in 1900.
Eighty years of the finest, cleanest, most holy-honest
living that a man ever put through. He was the father
of the murdered boy, Richard Quilter. He was the
father of the lady called Aunt Gracia in the letters.
And he was the grandfather of Richard’s three children:
Neal, Judith, and Lucy. Their grandmother, Thaddeus
Quilter’s wife, had been dead a good many years.</p>

<p>“Taking them in the order of their ages, Phineas
Quilter, the youngest of the three brothers, you know,
comes next. He was sixty-seven years old in 1900, and
he was a great old boy. He’d spent a good part of his
time hunting for gold mines in Oregon and Nevada;
he never fared very far, but he fared often. It was his
diversion. He was a happy-go-lucky, but good—good
as his gold all the way through. He was a cut-up, strong
for practical jokes—all like that. A little gay and fizzy
in his youth, maybe; but he came out fine and mellow
in his old age. His wife called him Pan when she was in
a real good humour. He liked it. That gives a slant,
maybe. But don’t forget that, like Thaddeus Quilter,
he was a fine, honourable old gentleman. Phineas loved
Dick like he would have loved his own son, if he’d had
one.</p>

<p>“Olympe, Phineas’s wife, comes next in order of age.
She was all right, a real nice lady. Phineas met her when
he went South, after the war, to try to settle up the
estate. She was what they used to call a reigning
beauty. She was studying elocution, and hoping to be a
great actress. So Phineas met her, and married her a
few weeks later, and brought her out to Oregon to live
on a cattle ranch—de luxe, but a frontier ranch, just the
same. Nowadays the marriage might have wound up in
a divorce court, in spite of the fact that they loved each
other a lot, right up to the end. Anyway, Olympe did
what women in those days generally did do, she stayed
married, and made the best of it. I can sort of imagine
her thinking it over, those first months on the ranch,
looking far across the sage and the bunch grass to the
hills, and saying to herself something like this: ‘I wished
to be a famous actress. I could have been, too, if I
hadn’t fallen for this young Lochinvar-came-out-of-the-West
stuff. Well, I did. Here I am, stranded on an eastern
Oregon cattle ranch. By Jolly, I’ll be a great actress
anyway.’ And then she went to it.</p>

<p>“From that day on she used the Q 2 Ranch for her
stage, and acted on it, with the family and their friends
for her lifelong audience. Now here’s the catch in it.
This acting business made her seem like more or less of a
fool. Yet the whole family loved her and respected her.
Folks will give love free, sometimes, but they won’t give
respect free. Olympe had to earn that. Bless my soul to
glory, if I know how she earned it—but she did. She was
selfish. She didn’t know much about gratitude. She was
vain. She slipped up on a lot of the virtues. And yet, I
respected her, and I respect her memory. I used to puff
all up with pride when she’d deign to be nice to me.</p>

<p>“That covers the oldsters. Did you get them?
Thaddeus Quilter, father of the murdered man; Phineas
Quilter and his wife Olympe, uncle and aunt of the
murdered man?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I have them straight.”</p>

<p>“Dick himself would be next of age. Do you want to
hear about him?”</p>

<p>“By all means; yes.”</p>

<p>“Well, he took after his father, Thaddeus Quilter.
Dick was more of a plodder, not quite so brilliant nor
quite so interesting as the old gentleman, maybe, but
not dull; not by a long shot. Bone-good, Dick was—a
fine, honourable, hard-working lad. He married young,
and he loved his wife enough to make her happy. It
busted Dick all up when she died. But he didn’t brood.
He took what energy he might have put into grieving
and used it toward being a darn fine father to the three
children she’d left him. Dick worshipped his own
father—but all the Quilters did that. I’m bound to say
that it was Dick, more than the old gentleman, who
pulled the Q 2 Ranch through the lean years and kept
it from going under. Dick loved Q 2 like a mother. He
had to mortgage, but he never sold an acre of it. Not
even when young Christopher, Dick’s cousin, was spending
a small fortune off it, gallivanting around back East
and in Europe.</p>

<p>“Gracia Quilter comes next—Dick’s sister, the old
gentleman’s one daughter. She was a healthy, sweet-hearted,
normal girl until she got kind of soured because
of a mighty unfortunate love affair. Right after that,
by cracky, she embarrassed the family a lot by up and
joining a new-fangled religious sect that called
themselves Siloamites. You never hear anything at all about
them any more, but they were pretty strong in Oregon
and Idaho and around there for a while. They were all
right, a fine class of people. I never knew better folks,
anywhere, than the general run of them. A couple of
handsome young missionaries came along and caught
Gracia on the rebound from this love affair. She was
emotional, and something of a mystic—she took after
her mamma in that. So she up and joins the church, and
gets baptized and everything. Never did her nor anybody
else a mite of harm that I could see. One of the
Siloamite tenets was never to thrust their religion on
other folks. But the Quilter family, including even the
old gentleman, felt pretty sorry about the whole thing.”</p>

<p>“Did her religion amount to fanaticism? Did it in any
way seem to affect her mind?”</p>

<p>“No, not a bit of it. Not a bit of it. I’m mentioning it
because it seems to me to be the one rift in the Quilters’
lute. The one thing that any Quilter ever did that all the
other Quilters didn’t root for. You know, like
Chesterton’s neighbours, sitting on the fence and shouting
‘Hooray!’ Something about Chesterton always reminded
me a little of Phineas. Great old boys, both of
them—though Phineas certainly kept his figure better.</p>

<p>“Well, that brings us to Christopher. He was the
elder Christopher’s son. Makes him a nephew of Thaddeus
Quilter’s, and a cousin of Dick’s. Chris was the
real showy member of the family. Handsome, as ladies
used to say, as a Greek god. He took more after his
Uncle Phineas than he did after his father. Though
instead of dreaming he’d find a gold mine, Chris dreamed
he could write plays. I don’t know, yet, why he couldn’t.
He’d had a fine education, here and abroad, and he was
real smart. But he couldn’t; and he wasted a pile of the
family’s money trying to. Chris was selfish, and too
easily influenced. Still, you’d go far before you’d find a
better lad than Chris was. He is a fine man, too; and, as I
always say, he’s getting better all the time.</p>

<p>“Just like his Uncle Phineas, though, he went and
married an Eastern girl who didn’t have a mite of
talent for an isolated ranch. Her name, Irene, didn’t
live up to its Greek meaning. I can’t say that I ever
liked Irene much; still, there was always something
amiable about my dislike for her. She was one of these
irritatingly helpmate-ish sort of women. Never knew a
stupid woman to marry a real smart man and not try
to run him.”</p>

<p>“You think, then, that Irene—Mrs. Christopher
Quilter—was a stupid woman? And, also, an egotistical
woman?”</p>

<p>“Was and is. Look. She, as they say nowadays, goes
in for it. She’s sort of deliberately arch—if you know
what I mean. One of the poor-little-me type. But she has
more to show than I have—a couple of fine sons and a
sweet little daughter, so I don’t know why I should be
running her down. She’s been a true wife to Chris.</p>

<p>“Judy, Mrs. Judith Quilter Whitefield, Dick’s eldest
daughter, comes next. She was in Colorado at the time,
taking care of her invalid husband. Married only a
year——”</p>

<p>“Perhaps, Dr. Elm, to avoid confusion, if we could
keep to the people who were at the ranch on the night of
the murder?”</p>

<p>“That’s right. But here I went and told you all
about Phineas, and he wasn’t at the ranch the night
Dick was murdered, either.”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t matter. Now, the others?”</p>

<p>“Neal Quilter was next of age. Dick’s son. The one
who wrote the letters to Judy. The one on whose account
we need to get this thing straightened out. He took
after his father and grandfather. Bone-good. Smart as a
whip. Never had any real schooling to amount to
anything. His grandfather and his Aunt Gracia taught him.
The kid was reading Latin better than I could when he
was ten years old. When he was eighteen he passed
the entrance examinations for Oregon Agricultural
College and was graduated from it just two years later,
with all the honours. He was keen about writing, always
scribbling things at odd minutes. But he couldn’t serve
two masters, and Q 2 was his passion. His grandfather
was his idol; but he loved his father better than most
boys do. Chris’s sons think a pile of Chris, but it isn’t
like the way Neal thought of Dick.</p>

<p>“Lucy Quilter, the little girl who wrote the letters,
comes next. She was twelve years old at the time, small
and dainty, and pretty as a peach—is yet. At twelve
she was the bud of what she’s bloomed into since. I
guess, from what you said, I don’t need to tell you
what she is now.”</p>

<p>“Scarcely. It must be marvellous to know her as you
do.”</p>

<p>“That’s what I think, when I’m away from her.
Soon as I get with her I forget that she’s a famous lady,
and start trying to boss her about her babies, or to
advise her about taking care of her health better, or
something of the kind. She’s as simple as common sense—and
as rare. Let me see—Neal, Lucy. Yes, that finishes off
the list.”</p>

<p>“No servants? No visitors?”</p>

<p>“From 1893 to 1900 were the seven lean years on the
Q 2 Ranch. They had a Chinese house boy, Dong Lee.
But, aside from him, Gracia and Judy—until she went
away—with Lucy’s help were doing all the inside work.
Dick and Neal were doing most of the outside work.
They had to have help, of course; but they got the
neighbouring men to come in when they needed them.
So many of the ranches went under in ’93 and ’94 that
help was easy enough to get that way, in those days.
But Dong Lee wasn’t there the night Dick was killed.
He’d been having trouble with his teeth—Dong Lee,
that is—and he’d gone to Portland to see a dentist.</p>

<p>“Now as to visitors. Gracia had had a couple of her
church friends, missionaries, there on the place for ten
days. There was one room built in the attic, and the
boys had occupied it. But they’d left the day before.
Nice, clean lads, both of them. I always thought it was a
lucky thing for them that they were well out of it.”</p>

<p>“You are certain that they both had left?”</p>

<p>“Look. Dick was killed on Monday night, around
midnight. Late Monday afternoon the two lads were in
my office in Portland, a matter of two hundred miles
distant (remember we didn’t have automobiles in those
days), delivering a message from Dick to me. He wanted
a prescription refilled and sent to him.”</p>

<p>“Was he ill at the time?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Dick had been having a lot of trouble with his
stomach.”</p>

<p>“Had it made him unpleasant, difficult to live with?”</p>

<p>“It had not. Quieted him down a mite. I think that
is an over-exploited theory, about pain making folks
mean. If they’re naturally mean, it gives them an
excuse for indulging. In my experience, I’ve found that
real suffering is anyway as apt to make a saint as a
sinner. But that’s beside the point, I guess.”</p>

<p>“No, I think not. But about these visitors. I suppose
you are certain that the two men who came to your
office, with the message, were the same two men who
had been visiting at the farm?”</p>

<p>“At the ranch? Yes, dead certain. I’d known the lads
before. I knew them afterward. Not a shadow of doubt
about it.”</p>

<p>“I see. Now, then, Dr. Elm, the situation you have
presented to me amounts to this:</p>

<p>“First, you give me stately, unassailable traditions.
That is, traditions based on proven performances of
integrity, stability, courage, reaching through two
hundred years. Then you give me the Quilter family of
1900, true to these traditions—wise, honourable, cultured
people, with strong family loyalty and affection.
A dearly loved member of this family is found murdered
in his room at night. That a member of the Quilter
family, which you have presented to me, could be
guilty of such a crime seems to be entirely without the
bounds of reason.</p>

<p>“But there was newly fallen snow that night. No one
could have gone away from the house without leaving
footprints in the snow. You declare that there were no
footprints. Someone might have hidden in the house,
and remained there until escape was possible. One of
your first insistences was that, because of the reliability
of the people who searched the house, no one could have
been hiding there. Also, the house was so carefully
guarded that an escape, after the first hour, would have
been impossible.</p>

<p>“Do you see it? You have precluded all possibility
that the murder was committed by a member of the
Quilter family. You have precluded all possibility that
the murder was committed by anyone who was not a
member of the Quilter family. And you state that it
happened twenty-eight years ago.</p>

<p>“Wait. You are a reasonable, sensible man. Why
didn’t you tell me, at first, that you didn’t expect, nor
entirely desire, me to arrive at the truth? That you
wanted a sound-seeming theory, which could be evolved
from the letters, and which might, by fixing on some
guilty stranger, cure your friend of his delusion? I may be
able to do that for you. If I can do it, harmlessly, I will.
I know, as you know, that I can’t do better than that.”</p>

<p>“I hate to hear you talk that way, my girl. Quitting
before you’ve begun. I sized you up as having more
spunk than that. One thing I admired the most about
you was your spunk and——”</p>

<p>“Temper your admiration, Dr. Elm. You aren’t in
your consulting room just now, you know.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think that’s very nice of you, Miss
MacDonald, trying to abash an old, white-haired man like
me.”</p>

<p>“I only wish that I thought I had, or could. Your
methods shame Machiavelli. I’m in terror of you.
You’ve bullied me into reading your letters. You’ve
bullied me into promising a harmless lie. If the harmless
lie seems inadequate, you’ll doubtless bully me into a
pernicious one, and the penitentiary.”</p>

<p>Dr. Elm said, “Bless your heart,” stood, put his
overcoat across his arm, bowed; and, though his two
hundred and fifty pounds would seem to necessitate a
definite solidity of carriage, Lynn MacDonald was left
with the impression that some gentle breeze had wafted
him delicately away.</p>

<p>She smiled, the rueful smile of grudging admiration
confronting the confusion of charm and guile. She
looked at her watch. It was too late to go home and
dress and keep her dinner engagement; it was too early
for anything else. An hour’s reading should take her far
through the letters. Then home, and dinner, and the
restful evening she had been needing for so long. First,
the list of people, again:</p>

<table class="personae">

<p>Dr. Elm had told her that Phineas Quilter was not at

check beside his name, and reached for the smaller
packet of letters.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="dateline">March 12, 1900.</p>

<p><span class="sal">Dearest, dear Judy-pudy:</span>
Uncle Phineas’s
dictum, “Never begin a letter or end a love affair
with an apology,” has been a hindrance to me in the
starting of this letter. Perhaps if I state that Dong
Lee has had another toothache, and that Christopher
sent us a telegram that came two days after you and
Greg left, and that said he had been married the week
before and would arrive at Q 2 on Saturday, March
ninth, with his wife, you may understand why I have
not had time to write to you.</p>

<p>All the preparations were exciting and much fun.
Grandfather himself helped me shine the best silver on
Friday afternoon. Dong Lee had been compelled to lie
down with a bag of hot salt on his face. Aunt Gracia
made new curtains for Chris’s room, and Olympe put
her best cloisonné rose jar on the lowboy. The one
drawback was that something so pleasant going to happen
made us miss you and Greg more tensely. We couldn’t
say, once, as we had said the day of the hailstorm and
rain after you left, “Thank goodness, Judy and Greg
aren’t here.”</p>

<p>Father and Uncle Phineas met Chris and Irene at the
train with the carriage. Neal had worked hard getting it
mended and washed and polished; but, of course, there
had been no time to paint it. Bread and Butter were not
as dashing as I wished they might be. Though Neal had
curried them carefully, they somehow did seem to betray
the fact they were generally used for ploughing. I
hoped that Irene might not notice it. I fear that she did.</p>

<p>Irene is pretty. Her hair is yellow. Her cheeks are
pink, and her eyes are turquoise blue. But, though it is
hard to explain, her prettiness seems inexpensive: like
the things we don’t buy in the shops because, though
attractive, we feel sure they won’t be durable. I should
add that this is not very noticeable except when she is
close to Aunt Gracia, and that, even then, Irene’s
clothes do much to counteract the impression.</p>

<p>Her clothes are very beautiful, and she rustles in them
as if she were walking knee-deep in autumn leaves.
Her trains make Aunt Gracia’s and Olympe’s seem like
something they just happened to be dragging about
behind them. On just one hat she has eight plumes, and
she said the shortest one was sixteen inches long.</p>

<p>She was very enthusiastic over all of us, and the place,
on Saturday evening. She has a way of expressing
appreciation by saying “oo,” with rising and falling
inflections. Sometimes it sounds as if she were running a
scale. She showed all sorts of deference to Grandfather
by constantly calling him “sir,” and acting humble. I
am sure that Grandfather disliked it.</p>

<p>Olympe came downstairs rather late, as she usually
does when we have company. She looked beautiful in
her old white lace ball gown and with her “Prince of
Wales” magenta plumes in her gray hair. Irene seemed
much astonished at Olympe; but then, you know,
strangers often do. Olympe was at her best. She lifted
her lovely chin (not once all evening did she forget and
droop her chin) and told Irene how great artists had
painted her portraits. It seems that a great artist once
wished to paint Irene’s picture, too. It is interesting, I
think, to have two beauties in the family at one time. It
is a pity that Irene uses so much White Rose perfume
that, whenever Olympe stays close to her, Olympe begins
to sneeze with hay fever as she usually does only in
August. But, excluding that, and a few other things, I
think the general exchanged impressions on Saturday
evening were all at least moderately favourable. Irene
made me happy by saying that I looked like a Reginald
Birch child. I was glad to be able to repay her at once,
and honestly, by saying that she looked like a Penrhyn
Stanlaws lady. But it was not original. She said that so
she had often been told.</p>

<p>On Sunday morning, when Father, Chris, and I were
showing her about the ranch she said, “But, Booful!”
(She calls Chris “Booful” in public. I thought, for some
time, that she would spell it “Boofel,” or “Boofle,”
and that it was a joke with perhaps interesting origins. I
have since discovered that she means “Beautiful.”
I should think Chris would abhor it.) “But, Booful!”
she said, “I didn’t know that your funny farm was a
truck farm.”</p>

<p>Yes, Judy dear, I quote exactly. I was extremely glad
that Grandfather had not come with us to be wounded.</p>

<p>Darling Father, as usual, met the situation superbly.
He explained to her that, during the hard times, it had
seemed wise to him to put in enough garden to supply
the family table, with perhaps a bit over, for occasional
trading at the stores, until the worst pressure was past.
He told her, of course, we still had cattle and horses,
and that, now, the South African War was raising the
cattle prices, so that the stockmen would soon come into
their own again. He added that after this he would
always have a family garden, however, and a large one.</p>

<p>She said, “It is a large family, isn’t it?” She has a
syrup-sweet voice; but, someway, the things she says
with it often seem to ruin its timbre.</p>

<p>When I told Aunt Gracia what Irene had said about
the family, she asked me why I repeated it. She said,
“We are a large family, aren’t we, honey-baby?”</p>

<p>“Aunt Gracia,” I said, “we are. But we are not a
large patch of loco weed that has got a start in the best
bunch grass.”</p>

<p>Father came in, just then, and when he found I was
writing to you he asked me to convey this message.
Your last letter, he said, has distressed him. You must
spare no expense when it is a question of comfort for
Greg. Quilters, he thought, had not yet reached the
place where they found it necessary to practise economy
on their invalids. He sends you and Greg his dearest
love. He will write you, at length, in a few days.</p>

<p>Just overnight, almost, economy has stopped here.
Chris insisted on having all the stoves right out and
the fireplaces reopened. They eat up wood. He says that
before next winter we must have the old furnace
repaired. Probably, before next winter he will understand
better. He and Irene brought us all presents from the
East. I have no enthusiasm, as yet, for describing them.
Perhaps, when you receive yours, my difficulty will be
clear to you. I think that Olympe is going to send you
the ice-wool fascinator they brought to her. It is
beautiful, but Olympe will never wear lavender. It was an
experience and a lesson to watch Grandfather being
grateful for <i>Richard Carvel</i> when he had so desired a
Miss Tarbell’s new Life of Lincoln.</p>

<p>I must run now and help Aunt Gracia with supper.
Dear Judy and Greg, I love you so much that when I
stand on tiptoes I can touch it in the stars.<span class="sig">—Lucy.</span></p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p class="dateline">March 19, 1900.</p>

<p><span class="sal">My dear, sweet Sister Judy:</span>
This morning I
found out an amazing thing. Did you know that Q 2
Ranch belonged entirely to Christopher? Neal says that
he had known it, but that it was so unimportant he had
forgotten it. I had never thought about who owned it.
If I had, I should have supposed that we all did. But
to-day I happened to hear Irene say to Chris, “But,
Booful, the farm belongs entirely to you.” She seemed
to be wishing him to do something, I don’t know what,
about the ranch.</p>

<p>I went at once to Grandfather. I suppose that no one
could question the assertion that Grandfather has one of
the most beautiful characters that ever was in the
world. No matter what great man I read about from Da
Vinci to McKinley, I always decide that Grandfather is
superior to him. Sometimes I wonder whether any of us
are grateful enough for the opportunity of having
Grandfather for an ancestor.</p>

<p>To-day, though I interrupted him when he was deep
in his new translation of Schiller, he treated me with
kingly courtesy. That is not an exact description.
Grandfather, I think, is much more of a gentleman than
are most kings.</p>

<p>“Grandfather,” I said, respecting his liking for
directness in all things, “does Q 2 Ranch belong to Cousin
Christopher?”</p>

<p>“It does,” he replied. And then, I suppose, he read my
feeling in my face, for he asked, quickly, “But, my
darling, need that trouble you?”</p>

<p>I told him that if it did not trouble him it would not
trouble me; but that I should like to understand about
it.</p>

<p>He placed a chair for me. He explained that, since
Cousin Christopher had been Uncle Christopher’s eldest
son, naturally he would inherit the estate. He said
that when he and Uncle Christopher, and, later, Uncle
Phineas, had founded this second family estate they
had agreed that divisions were unwise. So, though both
Grandfather and Uncle Phineas had put their fortunes
into the ranch, they had desired it to be inherited,
though not entailed, as the estates in England are. He
explained to me why that is the wisest way. I am sure
you know about that; so I shan’t bother you with a
repetition. Grandfather also said that, of course, mine
and thine never had, and never could, mean anything
to the Quilter family.</p>

<p>We have often heard that. I suppose we have always
believed it. At any rate, I stopped questioning
Grandfather and went and looked up the word “bounty” in
the dictionary. It meant what I had thought. So, when
Aunt Gracia and I were ironing, I asked her why if
<i>meum</i> and <i>teum</i> really meant nothing to a Quilter, it
could be true that we had been living on Christopher’s
bounty all these years.</p>

<p>She seemed shocked, but controlledly so, and said
what a very funny baby I was, and where had I
managed to pick up so mad an idea.</p>

<p>I told her Irene had said to Chris that, after all, the
“farm” belonged to him, and that all these people had
been living on his bounty for years and years.</p>

<p>Aunt Gracia said that, of course, I had to do what
seemed best to me; but that she was sorry my ideas of
rectitude, and of being Grandfather’s granddaughter,
seemed to allow me to eavesdrop. She finished ironing
one of Irene’s beautiful corset covers, trimmed with
yards of lace ruffling, before she said another word. I
ironed plain pillow shams in silent humiliation. Oddly,
the next thing she said was, “What did Christopher
say?”</p>

<p>“He called her a delightful little imbecile,” I said,
“and that ended the conversation.”</p>

<p>“Necessarily, one would think,” Aunt Gracia smiled.
But I explained that they stopped conversing in order
to begin kissing. They kiss constantly. Uncle Phineas
says that is entirely good form for honeymoons. Perhaps
he is joking. It seems strange. You and Greg didn’t.
At least, not lavishly and in public.</p>

<p>Olympe came into the kitchen to see whether her
second-best taffeta petticoat had split from being
laundered. (It had.)</p>

<p>Aunt Gracia said, “Olympe, dear, why do some
women like to be called imbeciles?”</p>

<p>“Because they are,” Olympe answered. “It is an
acid test. However, if that young person doesn’t stop
calling me Aunt Olympe, I shall find something to call
her that won’t please her.”</p>

<p>We have told Irene that Olympe objects to the
“Aunt,” but Irene says she can’t remember. I think
Olympe and Irene do not love each other, as yet. I
believe I haven’t told you of an odd mannerism of
Irene’s. She talks all the time—incessantly is the
exact word. It is particularly hard for Olympe. Since all
the rest of the family are so busy—Chris has pitched
right in and is helping Father and Neal with the ranch
work—it leaves only Olympe for Irene to talk to. We
could say now, though we do not, how fortunate it is that
Greg is not here. Olympe does not have to sit quietly in
a chair. She can walk away. She often does.</p>

<p>Your letter telling of Greg’s improvement brought
us all bright joy. I love you so much that if it were
planted as a clover seed it would grow as a
meadow.<span class="sig">—Lucy.</span></p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p class="dateline">March 26, 1900.</p>

<p><span class="sal">Dearest, dearest Judith:</span>
You asked me in your letter
that came last Monday to write to you more about
Grandfather. Grandfather, of late, has spent more time
than usual in his room, and has been more subdued.
There seemed to be not much to write about him. So,
after I had read your letter, I decided to have a talk
with him in order to gather material for my next letter
to you.</p>

<p>Olympe—this is not changing the subject—has
developed deafness. As you know, she has been very
slightly deaf for some time; but, of late, she pretends to
be totally deaf. I say pretends, because she is deaf only
when she is with Irene. My problem was: is that wise of
Olympe, or is it wrong?</p>

<p>For several months I have felt that it would be beneficial
for me to discuss the question of right and wrong,
again, with Grandfather. Last year, when I wished to
discuss it, he gave me a rule of conduct, you know,
“Search for beauty,” and said we would better
postpone the other for a while.</p>

<p>Yesterday, then, after a quick ride with Neal over
the south range (Neal was so adorable. He let me ride
Tuesday’s Child for the first time, and took Thursday’s
Child for himself), to pink my cheeks as Grandfather
likes to see them, I went and rapped on his door.</p>

<p>I suppose a man would have to be as great as Grandfather
is to be able to make other, quite unimportant,
people feel almost great themselves when they enter his
presence.</p>

<p>I gave my problem to him. He laughed very heartily
and then said that, according to Hume, whom he had
been reading when I came in, Olympe was justified.
Hume, he told me, was an Eighteenth Century historian
and philosopher—a better philosopher than historian—who
held that utility was the chief element of all
virtue.</p>

<p>“You see,” he explained, “according to this gentleman,
Olympe’s act, since it is so useful, could not be
wrong.”</p>

<p>Disappointingly, with that he changed the subject
and began to talk about loyalty. It was all interesting,
as related by Grandfather; but, since it was mostly the
same history of the Quilter family, and their courage
and loyalty since the time of Cromwell, you would not
care to have me repeat it here. Grandfather, of course,
knew that I had heard it many times before, and
explained that he was using it to make his point—since
Irene was now a Quilter we owed loyalty to her.</p>

<p>“Then,” I questioned, “if you didn’t laugh, you’d
really think it was wrong of Olympe to pretend to be
deaf?”</p>

<p>Again Grandfather disappointed me by saying that I
was a bit young to penetrate Hume.</p>

<p>I picked up my notebook and started to go away.
Grandfather asked me what I had there. I told him I
had brought my notebook to write in it what he would
tell me about right and wrong. He asked me what I
had written. I had not written anything. He was
troubled. I hurried to explain that it did not matter.
He was still troubled. I suggested that it might be wise
for me to ask Aunt Gracia about right and wrong. She
has them both so neatly.</p>

<p>Grandfather said, “Heaven forbid.” And, again, he
said that I was too young to be delving into moral issues.
He said, perhaps, I would allow him to write a few simple
rules of conduct in my notebook for me to use until
I was older. He took my book and wrote:</p>

<p>“Darling little Lucy Quilter. Be proud. Be loyal. Be
gay. Be generous rather than just.”</p>

<p>After I left Grandfather’s room I met Uncle Phineas
and Irene in the hall. She had been talking to him. She
went away. I said to Uncle Phineas, because Irene had
looked so pink and blue and gold, “How lovely she is!”</p>

<p>He pulled my top curl and made up a face at me.</p>

<p>“I mean,” I explained, feeling that lovely had been a
little extravagant—you know, one would call Aunt
Gracia lovely, “how pretty, how delicate.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Uncle Phineas said, “pretty and delicate as a
somersault.” Uncle Phineas does not like Irene at all.</p>

<p>I told him then, since I thought he should know, what
Grandfather had been telling me about our owing Irene
our loyalty. How family loyalty was one of our strongest
traditions. Uncle Phineas said: “Thad goes about
brandishing Quilter loyalty like a club.” You may imagine
what a terrible humour Uncle Phineas must have been
in to criticize Grandfather.</p>

<p>Later that evening, when I was showing Neal my
new rules of conduct, Uncle Phineas came up. Neal
showed them to him, after asking my permission, which
it seemed rude to withhold.</p>

<p>Uncle Phineas said he would give me one more. He
took my notebook, and wrote, scrawlingly, right under
Grandfather’s beautiful, patient lettering: “Be wise.
Use Wisdom’s Robertine.” That, as you may not know,
is a cosmetic which comes in dark blue glass bottles.
Irene has one, and she gave one to Olympe. I thought it
generous of her. Neal says that Irene will never miss one
bottle.</p>

<p>It is difficult to explain, but here of late, hatefulness
seems to have got hold of all of us. I should say, all of us
except Grandfather, who is too perfect, and Father,
who is too busy. Darling Father, not busy, wouldn’t be
hateful, either, I am sure. But the thought of work as a
producer of virtue has given me an idea for a story. I
have put it in my notebook, and shall write it when I
am grown up. It is to be about two men; one who has all
the virtues, and one who has none of them, but who is
egotistic and avaricious. He has to work so hard to
satisfy his vanity and his avarice, and he has to do such
good things to get the glory and admiration he wants,
that he leads as virtuous a life as does the good man.
When they both die, they are regarded with equal
respect by their neighbours. <i>Two Roads</i> would be the
title for it.</p>

<p>As I finished writing that last paragraph, Neal came
in. I told him that I had come to the end of my letter,
but that I was trying to think of some extra special
way to express my love for you and Greg. I asked him
how he liked, “I love you so much that, just from what
spills over, I love the whole world.” He evaded, and
teased, and said he did not want to be loved from leakage,
and so on. But, finally, though he was very sweet,
he reminded me of Grandfather’s rule about simplicity,
and he said that it seemed to him that love, more than
anything else, should be simply expressed. I suppose he
is right. So, I love you. I love Greg.<span class="sig">—Lucy.</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="dateline">April 12, 1900.</p>

<p><span class="sal">Dearest, dearest Judy-pudy:</span>
“Begin at
the beginning,” like many other rules, seems very
simple. It is not. How is one to know where the
beginning is?</p>

<p>I have decided that, probably, the beginning of this
very long letter, which I am planning to write to you
this afternoon and evening, should be that Irene does
not like Q 2 Ranch. She does not wish to live here, or to
have Christopher live here.</p>

<p>When they came last month, they came only for a
visit. But when Chris found that we had been sending
him all the ready money we could get, and had been
forced to practise rigid economy, he refused to take
Irene back to New York. Father agrees with Chris that
he and Irene should stay here for the present.</p>

<p>Chris says certainly, that nothing else is to be
considered. He says if he had had the least notion of how
things were with us here at home, he would have come
home two years ago when he returned from the Continent.
He said that, of course, by staying in New York
and attempting to get his play produced, he felt that he
was doing his share. Because, if <i>Gold</i> had been
successful, we never would have had another money worry
again. He says effort must weigh, as well as
accomplishment.</p>

<p>Irene said that Booful had worked very hard and
lived most frugally in New York. Chris said that he had
not lived half as frugally as he would have had he
known that his living was literally coming out of our
pantry and off our backs.</p>

<p>Irene and Father both said “Nonsense” to that, but
they said it differently. Just the same, Judy, in spite of
Father’s “Nonsense,” can you ever remember a time
when about all the ready money we had did not have to
be sent off to Cousin Christopher?</p>

<p>Chris said that he had had his chance, and that you
had not had yours (he meant about your not going to a
university), but that now we must all pull together to
see that Neal and I had ours.</p>

<p>Father agreed with him. He rather overagreed with
him. He said that Chris had had a bit more than his
chance, he thought. That he had two degrees, and two
years of European travel. He said that Chris was a
sophomore at Princeton when he was Neal’s age.</p>

<p>Neal began to say, as he always says, that he did not
care for a classical education; that all he needed was a
few years at a good agricultural college. Father spoke
almost abruptly to him. Neal walked right away out of
the room.</p>

<p>When Neal was gone, that left Grandfather, Father,
Chris, Irene, and me in the sitting room. I was reading
in the window nook. I think that the others did not
know I was there. I was not eavesdropping because, if
any of them had turned around and looked at me, I was
plainly there to be seen.</p>

<p>Irene said that if an agricultural college was all Neal
cared about, why couldn’t he be sent to the Oregon one,
which she had heard was fairly possible.</p>

<p>Darling Father has been having that stomach trouble
again. You know how quiet and patient it makes him.
He just sat there, white, and did not answer Irene at all.</p>

<p>Grandfather told her that, just now, even the state
agricultural college was a bit more than we could
manage.</p>

<p>Irene said, “Couldn’t you mortgage some more of
Chris’s land?”</p>

<p>Grandfather explained to her that the ranch was
over-mortgaged now. He went on and told her about how bad
ranching conditions had been, and how in 1895 cows
were selling for from five to seven dollars, and calves for
two, and horses about the same. He told how it had
been necessary to disperse most of the herds because we
could not afford to keep them. And then he told how
timber and teams had kept us going. And how, after that,
the mortgages had been necessary to buy new herds,
and to pay debts contracted when we couldn’t even
mortgage. He finished by telling her how, if we could
devote the coming two or three years to keeping up our
interest, and our herds, and so on, we were bound to win
through with flying colours.</p>

<p>I don’t know why that should have made Irene angry.
It did. It made her so angry that her voice trembled as
she asked Grandfather whether he actually meant that
the place was so deeply in debt that no more money
could be raised on it.</p>

<p>Grandfather told her that he doubted whether another
hundred dollars could be borrowed on the place.
He said that now it need not be borrowed. He said she
had spoken of raising money. We were now, he told her,
engaged in raising money—cattle and horses.</p>

<p>She has a queer way, I think I may have mentioned it
before, of seeming to hear only a part, the first part of
whatever one says to her. She has another odd mannerism.
She interrupts. She interrupted Grandfather then,
and said that, in other words, the place was worthless.</p>

<p>Grandfather said to Christopher, “Sir, can you
explain to me how your wife happens to be labouring
under such a misconception?”</p>

<p>Usually, when anybody asks Christopher a question,
Irene answers it. “I know,” she said, “that when a farm
of this size is mortgaged up to the hilt, so that not even
a hundred dollars can be raised on it, that it is a failure.
I don’t believe in throwing good money after bad. It
seems to me that the only thing to do is to sell the place,
if possible, and invest the money more wisely.”</p>

<p>Judy, did you ever consider how much worse things
words can say than people can ever do? I think that
must be because actions can be met with actions, but
some words have no words for answers.</p>

<p>For quite a long time no one said anything. I felt my
heart drop into my stomach, and then—I actually could
feel this—my stomach closed around it somewhat as a
sea anemone closes—and stuck to it. It was painful.</p>

<p>“Uncle Thaddeus, Dick,” Christopher managed to
say, “Irene doesn’t understand.”</p>

<p>Grandfather stood up. He looked majestic. “That,
Christopher,” he said, “is, I think, your fault and not
your wife’s. You should have explained to her that men
do not sell their inheritance. That it is not theirs to sell.”</p>

<p>Grandfather and Father went out of the room
together.</p>

<p>Christopher said to Irene, “Uncle Thaddeus is right,
sweetheart. It is my fault. I should have explained——”</p>

<p>“Explain!” she burst out. “If there is anything in
the world that you haven’t explained to me concerning
Quilter precedents and traditions, I hope I may never
have to hear it. You go about, every one of you, buttered
with precedent, greased with traditions. Like the pig
at the circus. One tries to get hold of you, and traditions
slip you through one’s hands. What I need to have
explained now is why a farm, admittedly worthless,
should be kept as a home for the aged and infirm. We
could better afford to put them all into institutions for
indigent old age. As for the younger generation, your
cousins are strong and capable—let them earn their
livings elsewhere. Why should we keep them with our
lives? Them, and their children, and——”</p>

<p>I made a dreadful sound. It was like the first part of
an enormous hiccup. It was drawing my breath in after
smothering for so long.</p>

<p>Christopher turned and saw me. He was glad, I
think, to have me there to vent his wrath upon. He
lowered his voice and became aggressively polite—you
know the way Quilter men do when they are angry. He
begged my pardon for intruding on my privacy, and so
on; and, at last, he said that he was bound to ask for my
promise that I would not repeat a syllable of what I
had, surely inadvertently, overheard.</p>

<p>Irene said bother promising anything. She said I
might run and tell every word she’d said, for all she
cared. She said she wished I would, and save her the
trouble; because, if I didn’t, she meant to.</p>

<p>Christopher, looking exactly like the man in the
Gibson picture, “Hearts Are Trumps,” said, “No, I think
not, Irene.”</p>

<p>“I have already,” she declared, like a dare. “Long
ago, I spoke to your Uncle Phineas about the possibility
of selling the farm. I’ve mentioned it, since, to your Aunt
Olympe and your Cousin Gracia.”</p>

<p>Perhaps if Irene knew it was like cracking us on our
crazy bones every time she said “farm,” she might stop
it. Perhaps she might not.</p>

<p>“I am sorry to hear that, Irene,” Christopher said,
very much in Grandfather’s manner. “Because such
talk succeeds only in making my family dislike and
distrust you, and accomplishes no other end whatever.
Possibility of my selling Q 2 Ranch ranks, in the range of
possibilities, exactly on a par with my selling one of the
children, or committing a murder or a
robbery—something of the sort.”</p>

<p>“You are robbing,” Irene declared. “You are robbing
us of our chance for happiness. Not murder, perhaps.
But you are condemning yourself and your wife to a
sort of everlasting suicide. You prefer that, I suppose,
to——”</p>

<p>“Infinitely,” Christopher interrupted (he got the
habit from Irene, I think). “But that must be said for
you alone, Irene. I love Q 2: I haven’t been as loyal to it
as the others have been; but I love it, and them. If you
would give me a chance, I could be very happy here.”</p>

<p>“Pleasant,” Irene said, “and interesting to hear you,
after we have been married seven weeks, talking about
me alone. Dividing us. Leaving me alone, while you step
to the other side with your precious family.”</p>

<p>“If there is a division,” Christopher said—I am sure
that they had both forgotten all about me—“you are
making it.”</p>

<p>“No,” she said. “Not yet. But understand this,
Christopher, I will not plan a life here—not even with
you.”</p>

<p>At that moment Olympe came into the room. She has
been wearing all her silk petticoats for everyday, since
Irene came, so she rustles almost as crisply as Irene does.
She was well into the room, she had come down the back
stairway, before she noticed us near the fireplace. I was
crying. Irene looked as if she were burning, and
Christopher looked like her ashes—gray-white.</p>

<p>Irene flamed out at Olympe: “I was telling Christopher
that I will not stay here in this hole. That, if he
plans to live the remainder of his life here, he will plan
to live it without me.”</p>

<p>Think, Judy, what a wonderful opportunity it would
have been for Olympe’s “Quilter men” speech, the one
she does like gray velvet, or even her “God help the
Quilter wives” speech. But she remained stone deaf.
She came to me, and put her arm around my shoulders,
and said, “Come with Olympe, sweetheart,” and gave
me one of her exquisite handkerchiefs and led me out of
the room.</p>

<p>We met Uncle Phineas and Aunt Gracia. Uncle
Phineas, of course, began to hug and kiss me and quote
the Queen: “Consider what o’clock it is! Consider
anything, only don’t cry!” Aunt Gracia tried to get me
away from Uncle Phineas to find out whether I’d been
bumped or burned, and everyone was all excited and
concerned as they always are when I cry. I wish they
wouldn’t do that way. I wish I might indulge more often
in the luxury of tears. It should be, I think, one of the
recompenses for the length of time one has to be a child.
Neal says they fuss so because I open my mouth so
wide and make such a noise. I can’t help it. I believe
no one can be heartbroken and fastidious at the same
time.</p>

<p>Olympe was very angry. She said a great deal. Among
other things she said that Q 2 was no longer a fit place
for a child, and that I had been forced to witness a
disgusting scene, and that Irene was threatening to leave
Christopher.</p>

<p>Uncle Phineas said: “Hoop-la! That’s the best news
I’ve heard since McKinley beat Bryan.”</p>

<p>Olympe said, “Pan!”</p>

<p>After supper Irene apologized to Grandfather before
all of us. She said that she had not understood about
Q 2, but that now Christopher had made things plain to
her. Of course, she went on to say, she had never
intended that the entire “farm” be sold. Her idea had
been to sell small sections of it, here and there; just
enough to supply us with what money we needed for the
present.</p>

<p>Uncle Phineas told the story about the man who
loved his dog so much that, when he had to cut his tail
off, he chopped it in small chunks, so as not to hurt
the poor creature so much. Aunt Gracia suggested
that we go into the back parlour and have some music.</p>

<p>Uncle Phineas played and Irene sang some of the new
coon songs she brought from the East. Then Irene and
Christopher did a queer new dance that is called a
“Cake-walk.” They say it is much more effective
when there are several couples. Aunt Gracia sang for the
rest of us. While she was singing Irene sat by me and
talked.</p>

<p>She told me about the new moving photography. She
says every face is recognizable, and that every motion
is made. I should love to see it; but, probably, they will
never have it in Oregon. She told me, too, that she and
Christopher had seen several of the new horseless
carriages in New York. She says it is positively eerie
to see them gliding along by themselves. No one here,
except Grandfather, thinks that they will ever be more
than a fad; but Grandfather predicts that, in time, they
will at least share equal honours with the horse.</p>

<p>I love you, dear, and I love Greg.<span class="sig">—Lucy.</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="dateline">May 1, 1900.</p>

<p><span class="sal">Dearest Judy:</span>
Neal says that when you say
for me not to write anything about people unless
I can write good things about them you are displaying
the worst sort of Quilter sentimentality. Uncle Phineas
says that your dictum would deplete the libraries. He
says to tell you that, if you don’t know your Plato, you
should know your Boswell and your Pepys. But Grandfather
says that the whole secret of the art of letter writing
lies in writing not what one wishes to chronicle, but
what the recipient can find delight in reading. So, I
shall try to write only good things about everyone in
your letters. Just now that may be difficult. It can’t be
helped. And, if you should change your mind, after
having Neal’s and Uncle Phineas’s opinions, please let me
know.</p>

<p>You ask what has happened to my lessons. It was
necessary to discontinue them for a while, after Chris
and Irene came home. Aunt Gracia was too busy to hear
them. But now I am having them every day with Chris.
And, of course, my Latin twice a week with
Grandfather, and my music and French with Olympe.</p>

<p>Chris has time now for my lessons. He has stopped
helping Father and Neal with the ranch work and has
begun his writing again. He was no real help, anyway, to
Father and Neal. And, when he writes, there is always a
possibility that he may make a great deal of money
and also achieve fame. He has begun a new play and
has the cast of characters all made out. The leading
man’s rôle is to be for Nat Goodwin.</p>

<p>Irene is happier now that Christopher stays in the
house all the time with her. We have tried to get her to
ride with us, but she is afraid even of Wednesday’s
Child. She says she would not be afraid to ride in a
ladies’ phaëton, if we had one. She has sent to New York
for some of her household things that she left there.
When they come she is going to fix up her room and
Chris’s so that it can be called a studio.</p>

<p>Yesterday was Olympe’s sixty-first birthday. We had
dinner in the evening and a celebration. Olympe sat in
Grandfather’s chair at the head of the table, and
remembered her chin, and was superb. Especially superb
when everyone stood and drank her toast with the table
claret we had left over from your wedding. Dong Lee
baked a triumph of a cake, and we put one tall wax
taper in its centre. (White wax tapers always remind me
of Aunt Gracia.) I wish we might celebrate for Olympe
several times each year. She is so transcendent when she
is happy. Even Irene said, last night, that Olympe was
not unlike Sarah Bernhardt. We missed you and Greg
so much that not one of us mentioned either of you all
evening.</p>

<p>I fear that what you suggest about my sense of
humour may be just. It has often troubled me. But
Grandfather says humour is a faculty which develops
late. He says one should not blame me for not having a
fully developed sense of humour, unless one is willing
to blame me for not having a fully developed stature.
He says that my sense of humour is coming on nicely;
that I have a sense of wit and a sense of the ludicrous,
and that the more subtle sense will develop as I develop.
I hope it is true. But I know that Grandfather is
inclined to overrate my abilities. Irene says he greatly
overrates them. She has a little girl friend, only fourteen
years old, who is a reporter on one of the big New York
daily papers. Grandfather said that he presumed the
child was an orphan. Irene said no indeed she was not.
Are orphans supposed to be brighter than other
children?</p>

<p>Dear sister, I send very much love to you and
Greg.<span class="sig">—Lucy.</span></p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p class="dateline">May 30, 1900.</p>

<p><span class="sal">Dearest Judy dear:</span>
I am glad that you have given
me some leeway about writing. Until your letter came,
it seemed impossible for me to write at all.</p>

<p>It is Uncle Phineas’s fault. He wishes to join the new
gold rush to Nome, Alaska, and he is trying to get Chris
to go with him. Uncle Phineas, while he doesn’t seem
old, is edging close to seventy. Chris has had no training
for hardships, and would not know a gold mine from a
gopher hole. We could not raise money anywhere for
them to go properly equipped. If we could, according
to the warnings in the newspapers, the expedition would
be, as Grandfather says, criminal folly. (Of course, all
I have been writing about this is gleanings from the
elders.) The <i>Oregonian</i>, a few days ago, had an account
of the dreadful dangers and hardships that gold seekers
are having to endure. But, in spite of everything, Uncle
Phineas and Chris forge right ahead with their plans.
It makes one think that Aunt Gracia is right about the
childishness of men—though Grandfather and darling
Father would have to be the exceptions that prove
that rule.</p>

<p>Olympe is wearing her dreariest gowns and is more
tragic than I have ever seen her. She has added ever
so many clauses to her Quilter men speech (none of them
pleasant), and has revised the Quilter wives’ speech
until it is almost heartbreaking. But Irene has reformed.
She offers quite often to dust the rooms. She reads
Elbert Hubbard, and Neal says that she is conspicuously
living, loving, laughing, and doing things worth while.
That seems well enough to me. Neal says that it is
wormy. Everything is wormy for Neal, lately. It is an
unpleasant new word of his. Marriage, he says, is wormy.
He has resolved never to marry. Even love, he says, is
wormy. He says it does to men what barnacles do to
ships. He says to look at what a fine, free-sailing craft
Chris was, before Irene barnacled him all over with her
messy love. Neal is growing cynical and pessimistic.
Grandfather says it doesn’t matter; it is an unavoidable
phase of male adolescence.</p>

<p>Some of Irene’s household things have come. She has
not unpacked them yet, as she doesn’t care to have
the room called a studio if Chris goes to Nome. Possibly,
then, she would like a <i>boudoir</i>. (She has been asking me
how to spell French and Latin words for her, when she
writes to her friends. I have told her for weeks. But,
after thinking it over, I decided, one day, it would be
kinder to tell her what Grandfather said about using
foreign words in one’s letters. She cried, and told Chris
that I had said she was vulgar. I had not. I apologized,
though, to please her. I didn’t mind at all.) She has
unpacked some of her linen, to put it in the blue closet so
it won’t turn yellow. It is not as handsome as our best
linen, but better than our third best and much more
fancy. She has big initials embroidered on it. The initial
is “B.” I asked her why, since I had thought her name
had been Irene Guildersen.</p>

<p>She was much astonished to discover that the others
had not told me Christopher was her second husband.
She seemed proud of it. She told me very admirable
things about her first husband, who is still living. She
divorced him.</p>

<p>Later, when discussing the matter with members of
the family, I found that all of them, except Aunt Gracia,
approve of divorce and think there is nothing even odd
about it if, they said, it was procured because of genuine
provocation. These opinions of theirs make it hard for
me to understand why none of them had told me about
Irene’s divorce. Sometimes, though rarely, I agree with
Neal, who is declaring, of late, that there is no
accounting for Quilters.</p>

<p>I love you dearly. I love Greg dearly, too.<span class="sig">—Lucy.</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="dateline">June 9, 1900.</p>

<p><span class="sal">Dearest Judy-pudy:</span>
Dr. Joe came out last
Thursday to see Father and, as Neal says, to sit
and worship at Grandfather’s feet. Neal himself
worships Grandfather, you know. That is why it makes him
angry for anyone else to do so. I made an epigram about
it: “Gods are not jealous. It is people who are jealous
of them.” Grandfather says it is creditable for a
twelve-year-old.</p>

<p>I love Dr. Joe. I think if he couldn’t dispense any
medicine he would still be a splendid doctor. When he
steps in, and smiles, everything always seems to
improve. He told Uncle Phineas there was no possibility
that, with his blood pressure, he could survive the
hardships of Nome. So that worry is off our minds. Chris has
decided to finish his play. He has it well in hand, and the
cast of characters all written.</p>

<p>On Saturday, Uncle Phineas started off on a prospecting
trip by himself. It was a blow to us, because we had
hoped that Uncle Phineas had given over prospecting
with that last unfortunate trip of his in 1897. But he
was so offended about his blood pressure that he drew
thirty dollars from the bank and went down into
Malheur County. (Irene thinks it odd that the checking
account at the bank is a joint one for all the elders. She
said so.)</p>

<p>Irene has stopped living, loving, laughing, and doing
things worth while. She broke a Spode cup on Friday.
Aunt Gracia cried. Irene said such a fuss over a cup,
when Haviland was prettier, and one of the Portland
department stores had advertised a sale of Haviland
china cups and saucers for eight cents each only last
week. She said for Aunt Gracia to dry her tears and
she would send ninety-six cents and get a dozen.
Doesn’t it seem strange that anyone, even Irene, should
not comprehend real Spode? It must mean that her
backgrounds are murky.</p>

<p>Something of the sort would need to be the matter
with a person who could do what Irene did yesterday.
She asked Olympe to give her and Christopher the room
that is Uncle Phineas’s and Olympe’s. Olympe was so
amazed that she forgot to be deaf. Besides being amazed
she was angry, and scornful, and amused, and several
other feelings. She, herself, did not seem to have her
emotions well sorted.</p>

<p>Aunt Gracia asked Olympe what answer she had given
to Irene.</p>

<p>Olympe replied that she had told Irene it seemed to
her that Grandfather’s room was, perhaps, even more
attractive; and that, since Grandfather had had his
longer, he was, doubtless, more tired of it than she and
Pan were of their room. She suggested that Irene offer to
exchange rooms with Grandfather.</p>

<p>Aunt Gracia put down the chopping bowl and went
running right out of the kitchen. When she came back
she, too, was angry and laughing. She said she had
caught Irene on her way to Grandfather’s room.</p>

<p>Olympe shrugged, in that sophisticated foreign manner
of hers, which Neal so derides, and asked why Aunt
Gracia had stopped her. It was time, Olympe declared,
that Grandfather was beginning to see that young
person in her true colours.</p>

<p>It is odd about words, isn’t it, dear? Now “young,” by
itself, is a pleasant word; and “person,” though lacking
in charm, is surely respectable and blameless. But by
putting the two words together as Olympe does, they
make an insult. Neal says so it is with people. He says,
take a pleasant girl and a respectable and blameless
man, and marry them and, likely as not, the result will
be a joke, or an insult, or even a curse or a crime. But, as
I have told you, Neal is developing into a regular Timon.</p>

<p>Olympe asked how Aunt Gracia had managed to
halt Irene. Aunt Gracia answered cryptically (this is the
exact word because I have just looked it up in the
dictionary), “Blackmail.”</p>

<p>Olympe laughed one of those ruffling lacy laughs of
hers and went away, because the kitchen was steamy
and unpleasant. I do not know whether she understood
what Aunt Gracia meant by blackmail. I understood.
Aunt Gracia did not know that I understood.</p>

<p>Irene, you, see, had told me all about it. Her first
husband, whose name is Archie Biggil (isn’t that too
bad?) was still madly, devotedly, ardently, tenderly in
love with her. He is an importer, and had been in Brazil
when she had married Chris. Now he has returned to
New York. He has found out about Irene’s second
marriage, and where she is living. He is writing her
passionate letters. There is much more to it than that;
but nothing, I think, that you would care to hear.
Irene was worried for fear Chris would find out about
her receiving the passionate letters. She told me because
she had to tell someone. I don’t know why she told Aunt
Gracia. I trust that Chris will not find out about the
letters. I feel certain they would annoy him. He acts,
lately, as if he were as much annoyed as a man could be
and remain in health. I think he was disappointed about
Nome and the gold mine.</p>

<p>I love you and Greg very dearly.<span class="sig">—Lucy.</span></p>

<p><span class="sal">Dearest, dear Judy:</span>
I thought it very sweet of you
to be sorry for Irene, and to have her remind you of
Ruth, sick for home, standing in tears among the alien
corn. Neal does not agree with me. He says misplaced
sympathy is the trademark of the sentimentalist, and
that anyone who could be sorry for Irene here, on Q 2
Ranch, would be sorry for the Black Hole of Calcutta
because it had to have all those people packed into it.
I am giving you Neal’s opinion, not because I think it is
very smart, but because I fear it is true.</p>

<p>I believe, if you really feel like being sorry for anyone
in particular now, it would be wise to be sorry for
Christopher because he is the only one here who deeply
loves Irene. Not loving, and not being loved, does give
one such a satisfactory removed feeling. You know, we
were so miserable when we thought Whatof was killing
the chickens; but when we found that it was a coyote
and not Whatof, nearly all of the heavy, hurting feeling
went away. I suppose, though, if we were to think that
through, as Grandfather always advises, we should
discover that it made no difference to the chickens, the
real sufferers in the event, whether they were killed by
a dog or a coyote. To carry out the analogy, we on the
Q 2 Ranch, now, are in the positions of the chickens.
Losing Q 2 would be a little worse than dying, don’t you
think?</p>

<p>Christopher has had an offer from one of the big land
companies for the ranch. They buy the big ranches and
divide them and sell them as small farms to the settlers
who are coming in from Nebraska and Missouri and
Utah. At first Christopher was indignant about the
offer. It was an insultingly small sum, he declared. But,
in a day or two, he was saying that suppose he did sell
a part of Q 2, leaving the direct home place and forty or
fifty acres surrounding it——Darling Father said that if
Christopher would show him how to make a living for
eleven people from forty acres of land, particularly the
forty surrounding the house, he would not have another
word to say.</p>

<p>Christopher said if he and Irene left the place they
would never take another penny from it, but would go
on their own from that time on.</p>

<p>Neal, who was present, asked, “Own what, Chris?”</p>

<p>Irene answered, “Not our own property.”</p>

<p>Aunt Gracia said, the other evening, “Christopher,
do you ever stop to think that right up to now you have
never wanted anything, education, travel, leisure, that
Q 2 hasn’t given you?”</p>

<p>Christopher said: “I’m not forgetting, don’t worry,
Gracia. Though that is over, now. I’ll never take
another dollar from the place that I don’t earn right
here.” (He is working hard on his new play. He has it
well in hand, and the cast of characters all written. The
principal part is to be for Mr. Sothern.) “What is
troubling me now is Irene’s health.”</p>

<p>“Not Dick’s health?” Aunt Gracia asked.</p>

<p>“Dick’s health, too, and of course,” Christopher said.
“But I am not responsible for Dick. I can’t do anything
about his health.”</p>

<p>“Can’t you?” Aunt Gracia inquired.</p>

<p>“Meaning, my dear?” Chris answered.</p>

<p>“That Dick is ill. That he is doing the work of six
men. That you could stop worrying him, and insist that
your wife stop it.” Aunt Gracia, talking like that, gives
you an idea of the conditions here.</p>

<p>Irene mopes around all the time and says she does not
feel well. She doesn’t look well, either. But she
eats—well, at least heartily and often—and she will never go
outside the house, not even in this new June weather.
Dr. Joe says that he is damned if he knows what is the
matter with her. Christopher said, “Sir, do you mean
to suggest that my wife is malingering?”</p>

<p>“No,” Dr. Joe said. “Do you?”</p>

<p>I must run now and help Aunt Gracia. I love you
both, Greg and you, dear, very dearly.<span class="sig">—Lucy.</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="dateline">July 6, 1900.</p>

<p><span class="sal">Dear, dear Sister Judy:</span>
Last night I had
a terrible nightmare. I screamed and woke. I
found unhappiness sitting like a giant on my chest. I
began to cry. Neal came in, wrapped in his dressing
gown. You know how Neal seems to lose command of
himself when I cry, so almost at once I had to stop. I
hoped he might go back to bed again. He would not.
He insisted on sitting on the foot of my bed until we
could, as he said, discover together what troubled me
until I woke crying in the night. Finally, after quite a
talk, we found that it was, probably, fear. Fear, you
know, of our losing Q 2.</p>

<p>Speaking of fear usually makes Neal impatient. Last
night he said—he is often sarcastic of late, but
Grandfather told me, privately, that was but another
manifestation of his age—of course crying was the best thing
to do in the face of fear or danger. He said when Teddy
charged up San Juan Hill he got afraid they were going
to lose the battle, about midway up the hill, and put his
head down and wept salt tears into his horse’s mane.
He said that was the way to win battles—to sit and cry,
as Olympe did, and make plans for the poorhouse.</p>

<p>I told Neal that, if we called it a battle, Irene must be
the foe, and that she cried most of the time—always
when either Christopher or Father was present.</p>

<p>Neal said tears were her weapons, not ours, he hoped.</p>

<p>I explained that I was not using tears for weapons.
I was using them for lamentations over having to
leave Q 2.</p>

<p>Neal said, who was going to leave? He wasn’t. If
worst came to worst, he would stay in Q 2 as a stableboy
for some Swede farmer. He said he would stay just as he
would stay in America and be an American if some
foreign power, even Spain, should conquer us. He said,
too, that just as there was nothing he wouldn’t do,
including the shedding of blood, to save his country from
foreign usurpation, so there was nothing he would not do
to save Q 2 for the Quilters. (For one thing, I think, it
was the Fourth of July only day before yesterday.)</p>

<p>What we must do, Neal said, was what Uncle Phineas
had tried to do with the Nome scheme: separate Irene
and Christopher. He thinks Christopher would stop
thinking about selling Q 2 if he were removed from what
Neal calls the venom of Irene’s proximity.</p>

<p>I thought separating them would be wrong, since they
loved each other. Neal said it was not love. It was
infatuation. He called me an idiot. I did not like it, so
perhaps I am not one.</p>

<p>I told Neal that it was difficult for me to understand
how so much trouble could be caused about nothing but
money. Money is real. It can be handled and earned,
and lost. People have it, to save or to spend. I have
always fancied that real trouble had to be about vague
things, such as love, or hate; or about unobtainable
things, like health for darling Father and Greg, or a
baby for Uncle Phineas and Olympe; or unpreventable
things, like war and death.</p>

<p>Father just came in. Aunt Gracia needs me, so I
must end this letter. Father looks very tired most of the
time lately. He told Neal the other day that he could
not work and fight both, and that he had to work. He
said for you not to worry about Bryan’s nomination.
That he would have been elected in 1896, if he had ever
been going to be. He sends you and Greg his dearest
love, and a check, and says there is plenty more of both
where these came from.</p>

<p>I hope what I have written about money won’t worry
you, dear. Aunt Gracia said the other day that what we
send to you and Greg to live on would not be pin money
for Chris, let alone Chris and Irene.</p>

<p>I love you, Judy. I love dear Greg. I love you both
together.<span class="sig">—Lucy.</span></p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p class="dateline">July 31, 1900.</p>

<p><span class="sal">Dearest dear Judy-pudy:</span>
Olympe says that she
wrote to you several days ago and told you about darling
Father’s narrow escape from death. All of me goes
empty, even yet, when I think of it. Fancy the wagon’s
tongue breaking when Father was driving Bell and
Zebub over Quilter Mountain! Grandfather had advised
against the team, but Father was in a hurry and Bread
and Butter are so slow.</p>

<p>If Indian Charles, from 3 O X, had not happened to be
right there, Father would certainly have been killed.
Aunt Gracia thinks that God put Indian Charles at that
particular curve to stop the horses, though, as
Grandfather says, that bears thinking through. It does seem
that the simpler way would have been to have had Neal
notice the tongue when he was overhauling the wagon.
Darling Father would be angry if he knew I had written
that. He says overhauling the wagon was his job and
not Neal’s, and that Neal is in no way responsible for
the accident. Poor Neal keeps declaring that the tongue
was in good shape a week ago, and everyone is being so
exaggeratedly nice to him that I scarcely see how he can
endure it. Even Dong Lee baked Neal’s special tart for
supper that evening.</p>

<p>Father makes light of the whole affair, though he
strained the ligaments in his wrist and has to wear his
arm in a sling. About all that Father is, is thankful.
Irene and Christopher were going with him and, at the
last moment, decided against it. If three people had been
on the seat, Father thinks none of them could have
stayed there. Aunt Gracia attributes Christopher’s and
Irene’s decision to God, too. Isn’t it strange how trying
to see the hand of Providence in things does confuse
them? I have been thinking a great deal, lately, about
God. I wrote a poem about Him. It is the accident, I
think. Until Uncle Phineas came home, the accident
had a most sobering, almost religious effect on all of us.</p>

<p>This is odd. When you and Greg went away, it seemed
as if the happiness we had had because of having you
with us never had equalled, nor made up for, the
unhappiness we had to endure because you were gone.
But, when Uncle Phineas came home on Wednesday, it
seemed as if the unhappiness of having him away had
been nothing compared to the fun of having him home
again. Uncle Phineas, I believe, is one of those people
whom his family appreciate more after they have been
without him for rather a long time.</p>

<p>He is in splendid high spirits. Perhaps he has found
another gold mine. No one, I think, has remembered to
ask him. While he was away, Olympe kept longing for
his return in order that he and she might make their
plans together for the poorhouse. But she has been so
happy since he came that she has forgotten all about the
poorhouse. She is wearing her gayer frocks, and giving
only her lighter, more whimsical speeches.</p>

<p>Since the accident, I haven’t heard either Irene or
Chris mention selling the place. Chris is working hard
on his new play. Mr. Joseph Jefferson is to have the
leading rôle. Also, Chris has done another sonnet to
Irene. He did it yesterday during our lesson time. It is
fortunate that Irene has so many splendid rhymes:
green, serene, sheen, queen, been (as Grandfather
pronounces it), clean, and dozens of others. Greg would
have a hard time rhyming you into a sonnet. But Greg
would never think of writing a sonnet to you. Aren’t you
glad? Not, of course, that I disapprove of authors, since
I am planning to be one. But I am going to be a writer,
rather than an author. When I told Chris that, and that
I was going to cover pages and pages with real written
words, and then stack them up and sell them, he said:
“Precisely. You are going to be a hardy perennial
author.” And then he gave me quite a lecture about
ambitions and bandbox zeniths. But Grandfather said,
not at all. That he had yet to associate real genius with
the ability for being enterprisingly unproductive.</p>

<p>It is past bedtime. I love you both very dearly, and I
send my love to you both in this letter.<span class="sig">—Lucy.</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="dateline">August 1, 1900.</p>

<p><span class="sal">Dearest Judy dear:</span>
Father and Uncle
Phineas and Chris have all gone to Portland for
a few days. They left here last Thursday. I think that
they will return to-morrow. Father had to see Dr. Joe.
I don’t know why the others went, unless it was,
perhaps, for the trip.</p>

<p>Christopher was no sooner out of sight than Irene
began to move Father’s belongings out of his room,
preparing to unpack her boxes and to instal herself and
Christopher in Father’s room. She said she positively
had not asked Father to exchange rooms with her. She
said he had offered to do so, because he had heard that
she wanted a cupola room in order to fix the cupola up
as an Oriental cozy corner.</p>

<p>Olympe asked her why she had not made the exchange
while Christopher had been at home. Irene said
because she wished to surprise him. (It is only by
remembering Grandfather’s sixth rule, under “B,” that I
am restraining myself from underlining almost every
word in this letter, and clubbing it all up with ! ! !)</p>

<p>Aunt Gracia and Olympe tried to reason with Irene.
She kept right along dumping things out of Father’s
room and tugging her things in. I ran and told
Grandfather. He would not budge. Grandfather, of late,
budges less and less. The only thing he has said about
the entire affair he said this morning when Irene took
him into the room to show it to him. He said: “My
word! My wordless word!”</p>

<p>Neal declares that he and I should try to be
broad-minded and receptive toward the new. He says that
forward steps should be made in house furnishings as
well as in other things. He says that perhaps the
ultra-moderns are right in attempting to get away from the
austerity of the early colonial furnishings. He says that
perhaps we do need more colour, more daintiness, more
luxury, and more invitations to relaxation.</p>

<p>Aunt Gracia says that if Neal and I find daintiness in
that room, her imagination pales before our conception
of a really honest, cleanly junk heap. She said that a
fishnet stuck full of trash was not merely inartistic, it
was also a wall-wide inducement to dirt. She said she
could get all the colour she needed from the Turkey
carpets in the front and back parlours that
Great-great-grandfather had bought in the Orient, or from the
pulled rugs that Great-grandmother and her sister-in-law
had made. She said the Oriental cozy corner was
not an invitation to relaxation. She said it was an
invitation to assassination.</p>

<p>Poor, lovely Aunt Gracia has grown bitter of late.
For one thing, I think that her blackmailing, as she
called it, has turned into a boomerang. Irene told me
about it. That is, Irene said that if Chris knew she
didn’t have to stay here, that Archie was pleading
with her to return to him, and that he would send her
the money for the trip at any time, she thought that
Chris would act very differently.</p>

<p>I asked Irene why, then, if she wished Chris to act
differently, she did not tell him about Archie? She said
that she was tempted to, every minute of the day; but
that Gracia advised so strongly against it she was afraid
to. She said that Gracia had known Chris longer than
she, Irene, had known him; and that Gracia was afraid
such a disclosure might result in tragedy.</p>

<p>I asked Irene what sort of tragedy. Irene did not
know. So I went and asked Aunt Gracia.</p>

<p>I could not get any satisfaction from her because she
was indignant with Irene for having told me about
Archie Biggil and his passionate letter, and the rest.
Aunt Gracia is sweet but odd. She does not understand
that I know all there is to know about at least the
theories of love and passion from having read widely about
them in books.</p>

<p>She said that unless I would promise her never again
to listen to Irene when she talked on subjects of the
sort, she would take the matter up with Grandfather.
I told her I would not promise, because it was
unreasonable for her to ask me to. Not, you understand, Judy
dear, that I liked listening to the sort of thing Irene was
always telling me. Dr. Joe did not like to cut up
cadavers when he was in medical college, either. It was a
part of his education that he had to endure. So I thought
that, since live men did actually say to live women:
“My God! The haunting beauty of your white body
never leaves me day or night!” I should, as a prospective
writer, know it. That is what I told Aunt Gracia.</p>

<p>She put her arm around me and said let us go and
talk to Grandfather. We did so. Aunt Gracia and I were
both astonished to find that he knew all about Archie
Biggil. Irene had told him, he said, because she was
troubled and needed to confide in someone.</p>

<p>Grandfather said that I had been quite right in refusing
to promise not to listen to Irene; that is, if I wished
to be a writer of the Laura Jean Libby or Marie Corelli
school. He had thought, he said, that I cared more for
Dickens, Thackeray, and Scott; but, evidently, he had
been labouring under a misconception.</p>

<p>I had a feeling that Grandfather was what Chris calls
“spoofing” me; but I could not be sure. Perhaps I was
mistaken. At any rate, quite soon, we got it straightened
out tidily.</p>

<p>An author, Grandfather says, must go about collecting
material constantly. But, despite that, an author
must use a definite discrimination about the sort of
material he chooses to collect. Grandfather says that no
person can gather all the sorts, because it is a physiological
fact that one’s brain has room for only a certain
amount. It was necessary, he said, to decide quite early
on one’s standards, and then collect in line with them,
to the exclusion of other material, in order that one’s
mind should not become hopelessly cluttered.</p>

<p>I feel that Grandfather should have given me this
information long ago. I am thankful to have obtained
it now before it is entirely too late.</p>

<p>It took us some time, you see, to get to the
explanation of the tragedy that Aunt Gracia feared.</p>

<p>Grandfather said to her that he, like Lucy, was not
quite clear on this point. He could not, he said, visualize
Christopher running about menacing fatuous
ex-husbands.</p>

<p>Aunt Gracia replied that it seemed to her the real
tragedy impending was for Christopher to discover
Irene.</p>

<p>Grandfather smiled that heavenly smile of his that
usually means a pearl. “He won’t, dearest. Set your
mind at rest. He won’t. That, in itself, constitutes the
tragedy—or the triumph—of marriage.”</p>

<p>I think that I do not fully understand this. But, since
I am sure it is a pearl, I am quoting it for you. You are
married. You may understand it. At any rate, no matter
what it means, exactly, it must mean that no tragedy,
like <i>Hamlet</i>, with everyone lying about dead, is apt to
happen.</p>

<p>Judy dear, I love you. Will you tell Greg that I love
him, too?<span class="sig">—Lucy.</span></p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p class="dateline">August 28, 1900.</p>

<p><span class="sal">Dear, dear Judy-pudy:</span>
It was good of you to take so
long to explain to me what Grandfather meant about the
tragedy, or the triumph, of marriage. I think it rather
bold of you to say that Grandfather, who is eighty years
old, is wrong about it. You are only twenty-two years
old. But it does not matter. I am no longer interested in
marriage. I have decided, with Neal, never to marry.</p>

<p>Though, of late, I dislike to be on Neal’s side about
anything. Some great change, terrible, grewsome, seems
to have occurred within him. (I know that is a poor sentence,
and that it is of a literary flavour which I despise.
But I have tried several drafts on scratch paper and it
seems to be the best I can do.) Or, to put it simply as
Grandfather always advises: If Neal had been a dog for
the past few months we should have been afraid he
would bite us. Now he acts as if he had bitten us and
were glad of it.</p>

<p>I do not know what has caused this change in Neal,
but I know who has. The person is Uncle Phineas.
When Uncle Phineas came home from his prospecting
trip last month, he came home with a secret. He told
Neal the secret. I am sure of this. They got off alone
together and whispered about the secret.</p>

<p>When I said this to Neal he was angry. He said to
have a person like me in it was a scourge to any family.
He did not mean that, I am sure. But he was very
polite, and talked in a low voice, even when he called
names, such as “rubberneck” and threatened. After the
many years of deep study that I have devoted to
character, I hope I have at least discovered that no one
gets as angry over anything as Neal got unless it is the
truth. If I had been making a childishly simple mistake,
Neal would have teased me and laughed at me.</p>

<p>Neal said that it was crumby—everything is crumby
with Neal, just now, but that is an improvement over
wormy—for me to think that Uncle Phineas would
share a secret with him and with no other member of the
family. It isn’t—crumby, I mean—because, if it were
rather a naughty or mischievous secret, as it probably
would be since Uncle Phineas had it for his, Neal would
be more in sympathy with it than would any other
member of the family. Not, of course, that either Neal
or Uncle Phineas would do any wrong thing, but—well,
you understand what I mean. For instance, Uncle
Phineas, I believe, is the only member of the family
who would join Neal in his plan to separate Irene and
Christopher. Of course I have no proof that Uncle
Phineas has not shared his secret with some other member
of the family. All I know about that is, if he has
shared it with someone else it has not affected the
someone as it has affected Neal.</p>

<p>Father has changed a bit since he returned from
Portland, but, if possible, for the better. I think that is
because Chris has stopped worrying him. Did I tell you
that Christopher went to Portland to try to raise some
money? He couldn’t. He has come home again and is
working hard on his new play.</p>

<p>Uncle Phineas has remained in Portland. Even though
he is not running up hotel bills, but is visiting Dr. Joe, it
does seem strange for him to remain in the city for so
long. Olympe is furious about it. She does fury
beautifully—not at all in an ordinary fashion, but with dignity
and hauteur. She manages it so nicely, I think, because
she blames Irene and not Uncle Phineas. She pretends
that no person in his senses would stay on the same
ranch with Irene if he could stay elsewhere. I should
think that she might blame Chris because he is responsible
for Irene. She does not. She pities him. That is worse
than blaming, of course. Though poor Chris does seem
to deserve to be pitied.</p>

<p>Judy, dear, he was stunned when he discovered that
Irene had exchanged rooms with Father. He came downstairs
alone, looking faded and like a poor photograph
of himself.</p>

<p>“Dick, old boy,” he said to Father, “I’m tremendously
sorry about this fracas upstairs. It isn’t that
Irene is selfish. She’s the most generous little thing in
the world, really. She doesn’t understand——”</p>

<p>Father said of course she didn’t, and neither did he.
He said there was no tradition that he was aware of
which would keep the various members of the family
from making an exchange of rooms, when the exchange
was advantageous.</p>

<p>It may be advantageous for Irene. For all the rest of
us it is an irritation. A dozen times a day, beginning with
the morning towels and ending with the evening lamps,
some one of us makes a mistake about the rooms. We
stand and knock at the door of the room that is now
Father’s thinking that Irene or Christopher may be in
it. And, since we know that Father is never in his room
in the daytime, we open that door and walk right in,
intruding on Irene and Christopher in a most
humiliating fashion.</p>

<p>Father himself forgets. He came from his bath, the
other evening—he was very tired—and opened the door
to his old room and walked right in. He came so quietly,
in his slippers, that Irene had not heard him. She was in
the room alone and she was frightened. (She said it was
partly because she had never seen Father in his
dressing gown before.) She screamed and screamed and
screamed. She cried, and had what she calls a heart
attack. Chris was frantic, and poor, darling Father was
stunned from the shock of having caused a lady such
distress.</p>

<p>During the heart attack, Irene said that any decent
house would have keys to the doors. Wednesday, Aunt
Gracia went to the attic and found the keys for the
doors, and shined them up with Sapolio and put them in
the keyholes. None of us use them, except Irene. Neal
is very smart about them. He says they open a new era
on the Q 2 Ranch. He has made up a song, to the tune of
“Bringing in the Sheaves,” which he calls “Turning
Quilter Keys,” and which he sings about, objectionably.</p>

<p>I send my love to you, dear, and to Greg.<span class="sig">—Lucy.</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="dateline">September 10, 1900.</p>

<p><span class="sal">Judith dearest:</span>
Christopher, I think, is going
to sell Q 2 Ranch. It seems odd and perhaps not
right that a private disaster like this should completely
overshadow, for us, the terrible disaster in Galveston
day before yesterday. But it has. I think that Christopher
gave us credit for more altruism, and so told us
yesterday when we were all so troubled over the Galveston
sufferers. I think that he thought our own trouble
would diminish by comparison. It has not.</p>

<p>When all the mortgages are paid, Christopher will
have about $9,000 left over. If he and Irene take half,
that will leave $4,500 for Grandfather, Father, Olympe,
Uncle Phineas, Aunt Gracia, you, Greg, Neal, and me.</p>

<p>Christopher says that we can buy a pleasant Willamette
Valley farm for less than half of that, and start
free and clear. That will be much better, he says, since
this place is too large for Father and Neal to handle,
especially since Father’s health is so uncertain.</p>

<p>Indeed, Christopher declares, Father’s health is one of
his chief reasons for selling. He thinks it is not fair to
expect Father to carry on this struggle under a load of
debt. Aside from the sentiment attached to the place,
Christopher says, a smaller place, clear of debt, would
be better for everyone. However, he says he will not
act hastily, nor counter to our wishes in the matter.
The offer is open for sixty days.</p>

<p>No one says anything. No one will say anything. I
mean, not anything at all. I mean, not one single word.
Not, “Yes, Christopher,” or, “No, Christopher.” I
believe that Uncle Phineas might talk, if he were here.
Uncle Phineas is lost.</p>

<p>Neal and I are the only ones who know this. After
Christopher broke the news to us yesterday morning,
Neal and I rode to Quilterville. We sent a telegram to
Uncle Phineas, in care of Dr. Joe. Neal had to tell me
what he was going to do because he had to borrow my
pocket money, to put with his money, to send the
telegram. We stayed in Quilterville several hours
waiting for the reply. When it came it was from Dr. Joe.
It said: “Phineas not here. Mum’s the word. No occasion
for worry. He is O. K. Joe.”</p>

<p>We had no money to answer that telegram. Neal says
he thinks that Uncle Phineas has gone on another
prospecting trip. It is odd, because Olympe got a letter
from him this morning, written in Portland and mailed
from there. I picked up the envelope and looked to see
the postmark.</p>

<p>Neal thinks that Uncle Phineas wrote several letters,
and left them for Dr. Joe to mail in regular order. It
would not be unlike Uncle Phineas. The fact that
Olympe had sent him her garnet set to be cleaned, and
that he did not mention it in this letter, might seem
to prove Neal right. Olympe has written, now, to have
him sell the set instead.</p>

<p>Aunt Gracia is going to sell Great-great-great-grandmother’s
silver tea set. It is hers, you know.
Olympe says the Turkey carpets belong to Uncle Phineas
and have ever since he settled the estate in Virginia.
She is going to have him sell them. The amount should
keep you and Greg in comparative comfort for a long
time, she thinks. Aunt Gracia is hoping for a teacher’s
position. She is hunting out old books to bone up for the
examinations. Neal plans to stay right here and work
for his board only, if necessary. Grandfather will apply
for his pension after all these years. It will be about
seventeen dollars a month.</p>

<p>Aunt Gracia has asked me to come and help her
now, so I must go. Dear, I love you and Greg very,
very much.<span class="sig">—Lucy.</span></p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p class="dateline">September 21, 1900.</p>

<p><span class="sal">Dearest, dearest Judy-pudy:</span>
If you have worked
out, in your philosophy for living, any special thing to
say or to do to prepare you for a shock, it would be
wise to say or do it right now. I have very bad news to
tell you.</p>

<p>The stress and worry of the last several months,
combined with darling Father’s ill health and the final
news that Q 2 is to be sold, has unhinged his mind. Just
a little bit, Judy dear. Not enough so that any of us had
noticed it. Truly, truly. We had no idea of such a thing,
before the blow fell. And, if the blow had not fallen,
we would not know it now. He seems just the same as
always. Truly he does, Judy. Perhaps a little sweeter
and kinder—but really just the same. So, when you
think of dear, darling Father, think of him as acting
just as he acted when you and Greg left home in March.
If you were to walk right into the room this minute,
you would not see a bit of difference in Father’s
mentality. Truly, truly you wouldn’t, Judy. But, dear, the
truth is that Father is now a baptized Siloamite. But
remember quickly, Judy, before this makes you ill or
anything: <em>Father is just the same wonderful man.</em></p>

<p>Wednesday those two pleasant young missionaries,
Mr. Cordinger and Mr. Withmore, came to the house.
Since they knew nothing about our troubles, and were
jolly and interesting, it was almost a blessing to have
them. If they had not unhinged dear, darling Father’s
mind, it would still be better than not to have them here.
They are staying on, in the attic room, for a week or so.
You know they never force their religious views on
anyone, or even ask anyone to join their church; so how
it could have happened that they unhinged Father’s
mind, I cannot understand.</p>

<p>To-day, when they and Aunt Gracia and darling
Father started to drive to Quilter River, we had no idea
that Father was not in a normal state. Judith, when
they got to Quilter River, Father allowed himself to be
baptized in it. They all came home and deliberately
told us.</p>

<p>Knowing Father as we know him, and knowing his
opinions of even less ornamental nonconformist religions,
of course such an act can mean but one thing. I
have not found courage yet to discuss the matter with
anyone except Neal, not even with Grandfather.</p>

<p>Neal says that he thinks there is some dark, sinister
meaning behind it, like blackmail. Neal says that Christopher
thinks so, too. If Christopher does think this, it
seems odd that he has now ridden to Quilterville to mail
a letter asking Dr. Joe to come to Father.</p>

<p>I do not believe that it was blackmail. Those two
young missionaries are the sort that Grandfather calls
clean, wholesome chaps. And, if they were wicked, how
could they blackmail a man like darling Father who has
led a perfect life?</p>

<p>Judith, dear, I think I am not able to write more now.
If I had found any consolation for myself, I would give
it to you. But I have found none. I have nothing to give
to you but my love.<span class="sig">—Lucy.</span></p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p class="dateline">September 22, 1900.</p>

<p><span class="sal">Dearest Judy dear:</span>
If only I had not sent that
letter to you yesterday! Or if only I had not spent all my
money with Neal’s telegraphing to Uncle Phineas, and
could telegraph to you now to disregard letter, as
Christopher did that time in the university when he
planned to commit suicide, and wrote to us about it,
and then changed his mind.</p>

<p>Neal and I have discovered that Father is not, and
never was for one moment, insane. I can write that
word now. I could not write it yesterday.</p>

<p>Last night Neal decided to go straight to Father and
ask him why he had been baptized. I advised against it,
fearing that it might make Father worse again. Neal,
fortunately this time, paid no more attention to my
advice than he usually does.</p>

<p>Neal was excited and frightened, though he denied it.
He went rushing upstairs and followed his own quick
knock straight into Irene and Christopher’s room.
Christopher had forgotten, again, to lock their door.
Irene had her hair done up in kid curlers. Neal apologized
and pretended not to see. Irene had a slight heart
attack. I think because she has assumed, without
actually saying it, that her hair waved naturally. It was
unlike Neal to tell about the kid curlers. He would not
have told a month ago. Sometimes it seems as if
Christopher were selling more of the Quilters than just
their family estate. Yesterday, I thought, he had sold
darling Father’s sanity. That is not true, because this
is what Father told Neal.</p>

<p>He said that he liked to pay his debts. He said that
the accident had frightened Aunt Gracia and had
started her to worrying, again, about his immortal soul.
She thought that if he had died not in a state of grace,
as she calls it, he would have been doomed to whatever
Avernus the Siloamites had manufactured. He did not
have their conception of it clearly in his mind, but he
was sure that it was shockingly unpleasant. He said that
Aunt Gracia had been a mother to us children, and had
stood with him, shoulder to shoulder, all his life. He said
she had enough to trouble her, just now, without being
troubled about him. And for him to allow himself to
be dipped, once, into Quilter River seemed to him a very
small payment to make to her.</p>

<p>Neal told Father that he could not go with him in
that argument. Neal said that he thought hypocrisy
was never justified. Father said he had tried to foil his
conscience with the same casuistry, but that he could
not. Father said kindness was its own justification. He
said that the sacrifice he had made to please Gracia
and to set her mind at ease was so genuine that it
cancelled hypocrisy. Neal said that he did not believe in
sacrifice. Father said, “Neither does Christopher.”</p>

<p>Neal had to admit, of course, that it always depended
upon the sacrifice and who made it. Neal could not
understand why Aunt Gracia should have worried about
Father, in particular. Neal said he had never heard of
her worrying about any other Quilter’s immortal soul.</p>

<p>Father told him why. Father said that we children
were old enough to know, and that he had meant, for
some time, to tell us.</p>

<p>Judy, a few months before Neal was born, a man
who lived in these parts then was courting Aunt Gracia.
Aunt Gracia was infatuated with him. Mother never
did like him, and she had once complained to Father
that the man stared at her. But Father said Mother was
so very beautiful that he could not blame anyone for
looking at her. Still, Father kept an eye on the man;
but he soon succeeded in convincing Father that he was
interested only in Aunt Gracia.</p>

<p>One evening, when Father knew that the man was on
our place, Father stopped work a bit early. He did not
distrust the man in the least, or he would not have
allowed him to be courting Aunt Gracia. So he doesn’t
know why he stopped work early that evening—he
just did so. And, as he was coming through the oak
grove, he heard Mother scream. Father spurred his
Cayuse, and got there just in time to shoot and kill the
man before he had harmed Mother.</p>

<p>Father went straight to the sheriff. In a few days they
had a trial. The jury acquitted Father without leaving
the courtroom. And the judge apologized to Father for
having bothered him with the affair.</p>

<p>None of this has ever troubled Father’s conscience at
all. He said there was but one thing to do, and he did it.
But he says that, since Aunt Gracia deep in her own
heart has never truly forgiven him, she thinks the Lord
has not forgiven him either. She even thinks that the
Lord would not forgive Father, unless Father made
some special kowtow in his direction. So Father made
the kowtow to gratify Aunt Gracia.</p>

<p>Not long after the trouble, Father said, the missionaries
of the Siloamites came to the house, and Aunt
Gracia became a convert to their faith. The religion
turned Aunt Gracia from a hard, bitter, broken person
into a useful, serene, lovable woman again. Because
of this, Father said, he felt that he also owed a certain
debt to the Siloamites—a debt that he was glad to pay.</p>

<p>Father said he told Aunt Gracia that he could not say
her religious beliefs were true, because he did not know.
He could not say that they were false, because he did
not know. He knew nothing. But, since her religion was
a beautiful, kind, and just religion, he hoped that
it might be true. And that, if with nothing stronger
for a foundation than hope, his baptism would mean
anything to her, he was willing to go through with the
ceremony. She told him that it would mean everything
to her. He was baptized.</p>

<p>Neal asked Father why Aunt Gracia’s foolish happiness
meant more to him than the humiliation of the rest
of the family, particularly yours, Judy, and Neal’s and
mine.</p>

<p>Father answered that if an act, which was both kind
and useful, could humiliate his children, then he was
sorry.</p>

<p>Since you have asked for it twice, I will send you my
poem about God. Grandfather says that it has a thought
in it; but he says that he thinks my medium will prove
to be the stately splendour of English prose. He named
my poem for me.</p>

<blockquote class="verse"><div>

  <p class="title">Omnipotence</p>

  <p class="i0">God was sad, and he sighed,</p>
  <p class="i1">“How little the earth men know,</p>
  <p class="i0">They think I am satisfied</p>
  <p class="i1">With my work down there below.</p>
  <p class="i0">So they blame me for blunders of hand,</p>
  <p class="i1">And they scorn me for tasks ill done.</p>

  <p class="i0">My burdens are heavy to bear.</p>
  <p class="i1">Why won’t they help me along?”</p>

</div></blockquote>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>A knock, demand nicely moderated by deference,
tapped on the glass of Lynn MacDonald’s office door.</p>

<p>Her secretary said, “Shall I have your car brought
around, Miss MacDonald, or shall I order your dinner
sent up to you?”</p>

<p>Lynn MacDonald added the last page of Lucy’s final
letter to the pile of pages in front of her and smoothed
it flat with her palms. Near the telephone were Neal
Quilter’s letters, a package of neatly taped temptation.</p>

<p>“Neither just now, Miss Kingsbury. I think I shall
stay here for half an hour or so longer. But you must go
straight home. I thought you had gone some time ago.”</p>

<p>“I can’t help you?”</p>

<p>“Not now, thank you.”</p>

<p>The tape untied easily. From the envelope with the
blue figure 1 on it she took Neal Quilter’s first letter,
and shook the thick folded pages free from their creases.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="dateline-day">Wednesday night,</p>
<p class="dateline">October 10, 1900.</p>

<p><span class="sal">Dear Judy:</span>
I am just home from Quilterville
where I got your telegram asking me to tell you
the truth about what has happened here. I told Grandfather
and the others that they had no right to lie to you,
and that they couldn’t fool you if they tried. I knew you
could tell from the crazy telegram we sent to you that
we were hiding something from you.</p>

<p>Judy, I’m going to do for you what I’d want you to
do for me. I’m going to tell you the truth. This business
of sparing you and all that is sentimental twaddle. It
isn’t only your right to know, it is your duty to know
that Father did not die mercifully and peacefully and
all that rot last Monday night.</p>

<p>Father was murdered in his room. He was shot and
killed. That would seem horror enough, wouldn’t it?
That isn’t the horror. That isn’t why we have been lying
to you. That isn’t what has beaten us. I’ll tell you what
the real horror is. And yet—it can’t be true. If it can’t
be true, it must be false. I’ll tell you why. I’ve thought
it all out. I’ve thought it all out carefully. It can’t be
true. I mean, it can’t be true that some one of us right
here in the house that night, some member of our family,
the Quilter family, murdered Father.</p>

<p>That is the first thing we have to do, Judy, you and I.
We have to prove that no member of the Quilter family
murdered Father. When that is out of the way, we can
think straight again. We can go ahead and find out who
did do it—damn him! And we’ll attend the hanging.</p>

<p>That’s why, before I tell you anything else, I’ll have
to tell you what I have thought out about the family.
You know I’m not as crumby about the family as the
rest of you are. You know I can think more clearly
about them than you could. I know that we are a doggone
faulty bunch. I have accepted that. I think it wise
to accept that, first.</p>

<p>Beginning with Grandfather, who is the best of the
lot now Father is dead. Grandfather is a sentimentalist,
and something of a poseur, and—— Let it go at that.
What’s the use? Next to Father, Grandfather is the
decentest person, man or woman, that I have ever
known or ever shall know. He’s not perfect, I suppose.
But he comes too darn near being for me to point his
imperfections. Any denial of wrongdoing for Grandfather
would be desecration. Grandfather’s world
revolved around Father—and Aunt Gracia and Lucy.</p>

<p>Now for the handsome Christopher. Chris is wormy
with selfishness, and lazy as a dog, and weak as water,
and conceited. All right. But when it comes to
murder—he’s as clean out of it as Grandfather or Lucy, and
there’s no sense in dodging it. Chris would half kill
Father with worry—he’s been at that, hard, for six
months now. But, in his way, we are bound to grant
that Chris loved Father. He wouldn’t shoot him, if he
had the best reason in the world for doing it. We know
that. And we know, too, that right now Chris needed
to have Father alive, as an excuse for selling Q 2 and to
manage the smaller ranch Chris said he was going to
get for us. Father’s death puts a decided crimp in
Chris’s plans.</p>

<p>Olympe. She’s vain and affected, and has her share of
common ordinary faults. But could any living being, in
his senses, suggest that Olympe would shoot a dying
kitten to put it out of its misery? If Chris has sold us out,
as he was threatening to do, Father’s ability to establish
us on another place was Olympe’s best chance for keeping
out of the poorhouse she’s been talking about all the
time lately. Olympe loved Father.</p>

<p>Aunt Gracia. She has had her mind all mussed up
for years with that fool religion of hers. She has gone a
bit sour, of late, as the rest of us have, from overwork
and overworry. But anyone who would whisper murder
in the same breath with Aunt Gracia’s name would be a
liar and a criminal fool, and I know it, and you know it,
and everyone who has ever seen her knows it. Just
writing it makes me hot. Aunt Gracia loved Father.</p>

<p>Irene. She is one of the crumbiest specimens I ever
saw. She’s at the bottom of Chris’s threatening to sell
the place—she has nagged him into it. She has caused
all sorts of trouble here from the first night she came.
I’ve hated her like a burr under the saddle. I hate her
yet. Partly because of that I know that she would not
commit a murder—could not have committed this
murder. It took a smart person, and a plucky person,
and a darn tricky person to get away with this business
on Monday night. Irene is a first-rate idiot. She is a
chatterbox, and a coward. Tell me that a woman who
is afraid of a cow will walk into a room and shoot a
man dead? Not on your life she wouldn’t. If she had
wanted Father out of the way, she might have tried slow
poison. She had no reason for wanting Father out of the
way. She didn’t love him, or anyone. But she liked
Father; she couldn’t help it. Three months ago Father
gave up trying to influence Chris in any way about
selling Q 2. Irene needed Father alive for the same
reason Chris needed him—his ill health as an excuse for
selling us out; his ability to manage the new place for us.</p>

<p>Lucy and I were the only other people in the house on
Monday night. The missionaries who had been visiting
here left Q 2 early Monday morning, and old Dong Lee
went in with them to Portland to see a dentist.</p>

<p>I’ll be damned if I’ll defend Lucy. And Neal Quilter
didn’t do it. I know that. The others here may not know
it. If I were any one of them, I’d suspect Neal Quilter,
and with good cause.</p>

<p>Read this, Jude. I’ve had plenty of reason to think,
here lately, that Father was losing his mind. His giving
up, and allowing Chris to plan to sell us out. And then
that baptism junk. Lucy wrote it to you. Father’s
explanation satisfied her. It didn’t satisfy me—not by a
long shot; not from Father. Father was no sap. Well,
then, suppose I knew that he’d rather be cleanly dead
than living with his mind worse than dead—and he
would. Suppose I knew that Father would rather die
than to have the Quilter name tainted with insanity?
He would have. You know Father, and Grandfather,
and their “ten generations of sound-minded, clean-bodied
men and women.” All right. I am smart enough,
and I have pluck enough to have planned this thing, and
to have done it.</p>

<p>Read this. Having Father dead doesn’t do any of us
any good. Having Chris die would have saved the Q 2
Ranch. Since Chris had no sons, the ranch would have
gone to Grandfather. Well, Father and Chris have
changed rooms lately. All of us were always butting
into the wrong rooms. I starred at it. Irene was
downstairs in the sitting room when Father was shot.
Suppose I had meant to sneak in and kill Chris, and had
been so excited—I would have been excited, I suppose—that
I got into the wrong room. Suppose I had seen a
man there in bed, and suppose I’d shot on the instant,
thinking that he was Chris. That is, suppose I had meant
to kill Chris and had killed Father, by mistake.</p>

<p>I am the only member of the family who is unsentimental
enough to do it. Or mean enough. Or, funny how
we’ll stand up for our precious selves, loyal enough to
Q 2 Ranch. Not long ago I told Lucy that I’d stop at
nothing, including bloodshed, to save the place. I said it.
I meant it. I must have had murder in my mind—or
the potentialities for murder—to have said a thing of
the sort.</p>

<p>You see, assuming that I did it, it works out smoothly
enough. I didn’t do it. I swear to God that I know I did
not. If I had done it, I’d know it. I didn’t do it. Lucy
knows that I didn’t. Lucy knows that within two
minutes after we’d heard the shot, she came running
into my room, through our inside door, and found
him—me, I mean—hammering at the door into the hall,
trying to break the damn thing down. But then you
know, Jude, that Lucy would lie herself into Hades to
save me from being suspected. This, though, isn’t a
question of her needing to lie. I mean, she did find me
locked in my room. I know that. It is a fact. I’ve got to
keep hold of it, and of one or two other facts that I have.
You see, you and I have to prove, first, that I didn’t
murder Father. I mean, that none of the Quilters did
do it. I mean——</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p class="dateline">Later, Wednesday night.</p>

<p>I stopped writing there and went out and walked
to the road and back. Breathed some sweet snow air into
my lungs. Cleared my head. Time I did, I guess. That
last page or so seems to be rather raving. Sorry. But I
am going to send it along because I want you to have
all this straight, and because, as Grandfather always
says, we do have to think this thing through—straight
through.</p>

<p>Straight thinking isn’t easy as yet. Writing does me a
pile of good. To write a thing you have to get it more or
less into shape. That is what I’m going to do. I’m going
to sit here—I am staying up for a few nights—and write
the whole thing out, in black letters on white paper to
you. It will keep my thoughts in order—you’ve no
notion what a filthy mess they have been in for the past
two days. It will do more than that.</p>

<p>I said, in the beginning of this, that it was your duty
to know the truth. This is what I meant. It would be
just like you not to think so, but you’ve a long way the
best of it, being off in Colorado and not in the midst
of this hell here. You should be able to think better and
to see more clearly than I can. I’ll give you a straight
account of facts from here. You’ll have the enormous
advantage of perspective. Together we’ll get the truth.
We have to. You and I are young. The others are old.
I don’t wish to be crumby and sentimental about it.
But you and I won’t even have a right to die until we
find who murdered Father. Out in the air, just now, I
decided that, if a member of the family did do it—then
we must find that out, too. You know, Judy; if not for
the sake of punishment, at least for the sake of justice
to the others.</p>

<p>Take a brace then, dear, and get ready for the facts.
They aren’t sweet, I’ll warn you.</p>

<p>On Monday evening we all milled around in the
sitting room, about the same as usual, as far as I can
remember. I have been so darn grouchy, lately, though,
and so much interested in <i>Descent of Man</i> that I haven’t
paid much attention to the folks. I have asked Chris
about Monday evening (one doesn’t quizz Grandfather),
and he says that no one acted nervous, or excited, or
peculiar in any way. An opinion worth nothing, I am
afraid, since he was so busy spooning with Irene that he
probably would not have noticed a fit on the hearthrug.
I think perhaps Lucy will know whether anyone acted
in an unusual way. But Lucy, poor little kid, isn’t fit
to be questioned just now. Aunt Gracia agrees with
Chris. So, for the present, we’ll record that everyone
acted as he usually does act.</p>

<p>Around nine o’clock Olympe went up to bed. Then
Grandfather went, and Aunt Gracia went with him, as
usual, to turn down his bed and so on. Chris and Irene
ambled out together. I waited until I was sure I
wouldn’t meet them hugging in the hall, and then I went
and suggested to Lucy that it was time for her to come.
She said she would when she had finished the chapter
she was reading. I heard her come into her room, just
before I went to sleep. I don’t know, nor does anyone
seem to know, what time Father came up to his room.</p>

<p>The next thing I knew I heard the shot, loud as a
cannon, bang through the house. I jumped out of bed
and ran to my door. It was locked. I ran back to the
table and got the lamp lighted and began to hunt around
for the key. I don’t know why, but I thought that the
door was locked on the inside. I couldn’t find the key.
I was scared. I grabbed a chair and began to try to
bang through the door with it. At about the second
bang, Lucy came running into my room in her nightgown,
screaming my name, and what was it, and that her
door was locked. I didn’t pay much attention to her. I
was crazy by that time, for the house was a bedlam.
Everyone was trying to do what I was trying to
do—get doors open. And everyone was shouting and
screaming to everyone else.</p>

<p>I had busted two of the bedroom chairs before I
realized what a fool I was—trying to crash a heavy oak
door with a frail maple chair.</p>

<p>I noticed that Lucy had gone. I ran into her room. Her
lamp was lighted, and she was showing more sense than
I had shown by trying nail files and hairpins in her
keyhole. All the time the noise in the hall kept up.
Everyone was shouting and calling and rattling his door and
trying to bang it down—everyone, that is, but Olympe.
I’ll tell you about her later.</p>

<p>I ran to Lucy’s window. I had some wild idea of
getting out that way. For a second, then, I almost
keeled over. Things seemed to break loose and stampede
in my head, and the only thought I could corral
had to do with Aunt Gracia’s judgment day. It took me
fully half a minute to realize that the new world out
there meant merely a heavy fall of snow. I opened the
window. Snow was two inches deep on the sill. I leaned
out. A cloud uncovered a ghastly moon. The snow had
stopped. Lucy came and caught hold of me and said
that we could not get out of that window. All this seems
unimportant; but I wish I had as definite an account of
everything that went on behind the other locked doors.
This may not seem unimportant to you. I am trying to
give you facts. You must try to interpret them.</p>

<p>I knew that Lucy was right about attempting to get
out of the window. I closed it. She was shivering from
cold and fright, so I got her wrapper and made her put
it on. She went back to her job of trying to unlock the
door with a nail file. I looked on her bureau to find
something that might work better. I noticed the time by her
little clock. It said ten minutes to twelve. It had seemed
much longer, but I believe it had been less than ten
minutes since we had heard the shot. Chris said that he
looked at his clock, as he lighted his lamp, and it said
a quarter to twelve. That tallies closely enough, I guess.</p>

<p>Chris missed Irene, for the first time, when the shot
woke him, and he admits that he was senseless from
fright. If he hadn’t been, he could have climbed out of
his window and have run along the porch roof right
there to the window of Father’s room. He did not know,
of course, that the shot had been fired in Father’s room.
But, if he’d had his senses—something that none of us
did have—he surely would have used the window and
the porch roof to get with some other member of the
family.</p>

<p>I found a glove buttoner on Lucy’s bureau and tried
it in the keyhole—fool’s work, of course. I think the
others were trying the same racket, though, for most
of the noise had stopped by that time. I suppose because
Lucy and I were together was the reason that we didn’t
call to the others. All the rest of them called. Aunt
Gracia, in particular, kept shouting to Grandfather,
over and over: “Father! Are you hurt? Father! Are
you all right?” Lucy and I could hear Grandfather
answering her, but Aunt Gracia seemed not to hear him. I
think she was too excited, and too frightened to listen.
Chris kept shouting like a Comanche for Irene.</p>

<p>I wonder, Jude, how we all knew that some terrible
thing had happened? Nothing terrible ever had
happened on Q 2. Why, then, the minute we all heard a
gunshot in the house, late at night, did it throw us into
a panic? I suppose the locked doors would be the
answer. Yes, of course it was the locked doors and not
the sound of the shot that locoed all of us.</p>

<p>Lucy and I were still monkeying with the lock when
Irene shoved the key into it. She unlocked the door and
said, or sort of mewed at us, “Your father!” and ran
across the hall to Chris’s room.</p>

<p>Lucy’s door was the first one that Irene unlocked.
Lucy was in front of me; so she was the first one into
Father’s room—that is, since Irene had left it. Father
was lying in bed. Irene had pulled the counterpane
close under his chin. Lucy ran to him and caught him
up in her arms.</p>

<p>Lucy is a thoroughbred all the way through. She
didn’t scream. She didn’t faint. She didn’t utter a sound.
She turned her head and looked at me. That was all.
The trouble is, the same paralyzed look is still on her
face. It has not worn off, not in two days.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>I can’t star myself, much, for the next few minutes.
Chris, Grandfather, Aunt Gracia, and Irene were in
the room before I had realized that Father was dead.
Then I thought that he had shot himself.</p>

<p>Grandfather took Lucy’s place beside Father. He
looked up at us and told us, “Richard has been shot and
killed.”</p>

<p>It would be Grandfather, wouldn’t it, out of the whole
herd of us, who would know without any proof, simply
and surely know, that Father was not a suicide? I don’t
mean to be crumby and sentimental about it; but it is
pretty rotten to think that, though Father had spent his
life earning such a surety, Grandfather was the only one
of us who would give it to him, then, on the minute and
without proof. I wish I might even say that, having
been told, we accepted Grandfather’s statement on the
instant. We did not. No, not us.</p>

<p>Chris said something about where was the gun. He
began to tear through the bedding hunting for it. So
did Aunt Gracia. So did Irene. So did I. There was no
gun to be found. Father was not a suicide. He was shot,
from a distance of at least several feet, with a .38
calibre gun. Since every man in the county who has a
gun has a .38 calibre Colt’s, we are not, in spite of
Chris’s contentions to the contrary, going to be able to
do much with that information. The point I am making,
now, is that Father was not a suicide. I’ll go into it
more fully, later.</p>

<p>It was Lucy who first called our attention to the open
window and to the rope. Now, Judy, read this carefully
and see what you can do with it.</p>

<p>The window was wide open from the bottom. There
was a thick rope hanging over the sill and out of it. One
end of the rope had been tied with a slip knot around
one of the heavy legs of the bed. The rope went across
the carpet to the window, across the window sill, across
the porch roof beneath the window, and dangled to the
ground.</p>

<p>Looks easy, doesn’t it? Some dirty cur had shot
Father and had got out of the window by means of the
rope. But the rope was covered with snow, and there
was not a handprint in the snow on the window sill, nor
a footprint in the new snow on the roof.</p>

<p>When I saw that rope, I would have jumped right
out on to the roof, if Chris had not stopped me. He told
me not to track the snow. He said that we must have a
lantern. I ran down to the kitchen and got one. Read
this, Jude. I have told you once, but I want to tell you
again. We swung the lantern out over the porch roof,
and the snow was a clean, unbroken sheet.</p>

<p>Chris looked at the clock on Father’s mantelpiece. It
said ten minutes past twelve. Twenty-five minutes, at
the most, since we had heard the shot. Not long enough
for the snow, if it had been snowing hard, to have
covered the footprints. We went to the window again. No
snow was falling. And I know that none had been falling
at ten minutes to twelve. There is no dodging it: the
rope had not been used. Or, as Chris keeps insisting, it
had not been used as a means of escape. Since he can’t
produce any sort of theory as to what it might have been
used for, I’ll leave you that, for what it is worth, and
get along.</p>

<p>The murderer had not climbed out of the window.
There were, then, just two things that he could have
done:</p>

<p>1. He could have got out of the house some other way.</p>

<p>2. He could have stayed in the house.</p>

<p>Grandfather said: “He has not escaped this way. He
has escaped some other way.”</p>

<p>“If he has escaped,” Chris said. “If he hasn’t, he is
not going to.”</p>

<p>Irene screamed, “He may still be right here in this
room,” and would have had a heart attack, if there had
been time; but there wasn’t.</p>

<p>With Grandfather directing, we made a quick,
thorough search of Father’s room. Chris, clinging to the
suicide theory, I suppose, devoted his time to the bed.
(He made one queer discovery; but, since it cannot
amount to anything, I’ll get along and tell you about it
later.) He found no gun, of course. The only gun in
Father’s room was in his clothes closet, twenty feet
away from the bed. His gun was fully loaded, and behind
some boxes on the top closet shelf. You don’t need
this, but I’ll give it to you. With the wound, if he had
had strength to move, which he had not, Father could
not have moved without leaving a trail of blood. Irene
had blood on the front of her wrapper and on her sleeve.
She got it there when she had been lifting Father.
Those were the only blood-stains anywhere that were
not on the bed covers.</p>

<p>The room was easy to search. There was nothing anyone
could have got under but the bed, and nothing to
hide behind. We pounded through the clothes closet, and
that ended the search there.</p>

<p>Grandfather said that Chris, he, and I would go to
search the house. He said for Aunt Gracia, Irene, and
Lucy to stay in Father’s room, lock the door after us
when we left, and close and lock the window.</p>

<p>Lucy said, “But where is Olympe?”</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>We all, including Grandfather, forgot the plan of
having the ladies lock themselves in Father’s room. We
all went rushing like mad things down to Olympe’s
room. Irene kept mooing: “I unlocked her door. I
unlocked her door last of all.”</p>

<p>The door was unlocked. There, stretched straight on
the floor in her nightgown, was Olympe. Irene screamed
as only Irene can scream. She thought, I guess, as I
thought—that Olympe had been murdered, too. Aunt
Gracia ran to her. She found that she was breathing all
right, that she had merely fainted.</p>

<p>Every second seemed precious to us, just then. So,
after we had made a quick but absolutely complete
search of Olympe’s room, we left Lucy and Irene with
her, and went on to go through the rest of the house.</p>

<p>I had brought two lanterns from the kitchen. I had a
notion of taking one of them and running out to search
the grounds. Grandfather pointed that, if the fellow
was outside he was, and far on his way. But, if he was
inside, we had a chance of finding him and keeping him
here.</p>

<p>Aunt Gracia had insisted upon coming with us men.
That made Grandfather, Aunt Gracia, Chris, and I the
ones who searched the house that first hour. Grandfather
said for Aunt Gracia and Chris to take one of
the lanterns and search the front of the house, and for
him and me to take the other lantern and search the
back of the house. Chris got the gun out of Father’s
closet and, at Grandfather’s bidding, I got
Grandfather’s gun out of the commode drawer in his room.
We thought it fortunate, just then, that both guns had
their chambers full, ready for use.</p>

<p>While we had been getting the guns, Grandfather had
been locking the bedroom doors on the outside. Irene
had left the keys in the locks, of course. Grandfather
explained, as he finished that job, that if the man was
hiding in any of those rooms he would stay there until
we were ready for him, or break his neck trying to get
out of a window.</p>

<p>Grandfather and I went down the back stairway. We
found the door at the foot of it locked on the sitting-room
side. (Irene had locked it earlier in the evening.
That comes in her story. Perhaps I should have told
her story to you first of all. But I think I shall do better
if I try to keep to the order of events as they came to me.)</p>

<p>As Grandfather and I ran back upstairs, to go down
the front stairway, I happened to think that the door
to the attic stairway had had no key, and that it should
be locked. Grandfather told me that he had locked it
with the key to my door. I am telling you this, in
particular, to show you how quick, and fast, and
straight Grandfather was thinking that night. But for
him and his alertness some loophole might have been
left, something might have been overlooked, as Dr. Joe
persists. I know that with Grandfather directing as he
directed all that night, nothing was overlooked.</p>

<p>We made a thorough search of every inch of space
downstairs. Then Grandfather insisted on going with
Chris to search the cellar. He asked me to stay on the
first floor with Aunt Gracia. She and I went all through
the downstairs rooms and halls again, and found
nothing. We went back upstairs to Olympe’s room.
She had revived, but had not got hold of anything as
yet. She looked old, years older than Grandfather, lying
there in her bed, asking over and over: “What is it?
Why are you all up? What is the trouble?”</p>

<p>I thought that we should tell her. The others wouldn’t
let her be told. They said we must wait until she was
stronger. Aunt Gracia skipped out to get some peach
brandy for Olympe. I noticed, then, that Lucy was
fingering a gun, fooling with it as she might have been
fooling with a hairbrush. I went and took it away from
her and asked her where she had got it.</p>

<p>“It was under Olympe on the floor when we picked
her up,” Lucy said. “I hadn’t really noticed what it
was.”</p>

<p>It was Uncle Phineas’s old .32 Colt’s. I broke it. The
chambers were all empty; so it could not have been
either harmful or useful.</p>

<p>Grandfather came upstairs. He said that he and Chris
had found no one in the cellar, and no traces of anyone’s
having been there. He had left Chris downstairs, with
Father’s gun, guarding the lower floor. He said for me
to go down and help Chris, while he searched the
attic and the upper floor. I couldn’t quite see Grandfather
searching the most dangerous parts of the house,
alone, while I went to squire Chris. Before I had time
to object, Aunt Gracia, who had come back with the
peach brandy, said nonsense. She would go down with
Chris, if he needed someone, and I should go with
Grandfather.</p>

<p>Since Uncle Phineas’s old gun was in my hands, I
hunted around and found some cartridges for it, and
gave Grandfather’s gun back to him. The attic was
the same old story. We were pretty thankful up there
for Aunt Gracia’s housekeeping niceties. It was easier
to search than the parlour had been. All the trunks,
chests, and boxes against the wall—nothing but vacant
spaces. Grandfather and I opened all the chests and
trunks that weren’t locked—that was all of them
except Irene’s three big trunks—and poked through all
the boxes, big and little. The partitioned room up there
was as clean and as empty as a dish in the cupboard.
The bed covers were all put away, the mattress rolled
back, the wardrobe open to air.</p>

<p>We came downstairs. But before we had unlocked a
bedroom door, Chris shouted to us from the lower hall
and asked us to come down.</p>

<p>He had got an idea, and a doggone good one. He had
been to all the downstairs windows and doors. Each
window sill had rolls of unbroken snow on it, and so
had each of the three door sills. Unbroken, that is,
except for the slight crumbling caused by Chris’s having
opened the windows and doors. He had put candles into
empty cans—they throw a much better light than a
lantern does, you know—and we used them at each
downstairs window and door. Read this, Judy. Nowhere
near a window, nowhere near a door, was there
a footprint nor a break in the snow of any kind. As far
as we could throw the light, say eight to ten yards at
least, the snow was a clean unbroken sheet.</p>

<p>Put it like this, to make it clearer. The fellow had not
got away before the shot was fired. If he had got away
since, he would have had to leave some sort of tracks
in the snow. There were no tracks in the snow. Ergo:
he had not got away. Ergo: he was in the house.</p>

<p>I said, “He is right here in this house!”</p>

<p>Chris cursed and said that he was. “What’s more,”
he added, “we’ll keep him right here. I think we’ll find
a good use for him—later.”</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>Well, Jude, I guess we kept him here. I guess he is
still here with us. We spent all that night, or, rather,
that morning, searching and re-searching the house and
guarding to keep anyone from leaving it. No one left it.
Up to the present, two o’clock Thursday morning, we
have found no one in hiding here.</p>

<p>About four o’clock Tuesday morning Chris took a
notion to go to Quilterville and inform the sheriff—Gus
Wildoch still has the job, you’ll remember—and
telegraph to Dr. Joe. He started out of the back door
down toward the barn. Irene stood in the doorway and
yelped until she made Chris come back. I couldn’t
blame her much. Grandfather thought, too, that it
would be wiser to wait until dawn.</p>

<p>When Chris came back, we tested our lights’ efficiency
on his tracks. They showed clearly. And, when
daylight came, there they were—a deep line of woven
footprints going part way to the barn and coming back
to the house. Any other tracks, which had been made
any time after the snow had stopped, around
midnight, would have shown as plainly as those that
Chris had made.</p>

<p>I didn’t think of it at the time, but I believe now that
that fact had something to do with curbing Chris’s
enthusiasm for bringing Gus Wildoch to the place. At
any rate, instead of leaving at dawn, Chris yielded
to Aunt Gracia’s urging and waited for some of the
hot coffee she was making.</p>

<p>Shortly after six o’clock we gathered about the table
in the dining room. Lucy had finally crawled into bed
with Olympe, and they had both got off to sleep about
five; so, naturally, we did not disturb them.</p>

<p>Aunt Gracia poured Grandfather’s coffee, passed it,
and said:</p>

<p>“No one has left the place since Dick was killed last
night. No one is hiding in the house at present. That
can mean just this: Whoever murdered Dick is in this
house and is not in hiding.”</p>

<p>How was that for a stunner, Judy, after the night we
had all put in?</p>

<p>Irene stuttered something about not understanding.</p>

<p>Whether she did or not, and I’ll bet she did,
Grandfather and Chris and I understood right enough. For
the first time in my life, I guess, I heard Grandfather’s
voice go harsh when he spoke to Aunt Gracia.</p>

<p>“My daughter,” he said, “that conclusion is
premature.”</p>

<p>Aunt Gracia replied, “I’m sorry, Father; but I have
been sitting quiet for hours, praying for guidance and
thinking. I can reach no other conclusion.”</p>

<p>We had tried to get her to stay in Olympe’s room
with Olympe and Irene and Lucy, but we could not
keep her there. So, at last, we allowed her to sit in the
lower front hall through the night. It seemed the safest
place, since we had the front stairway door locked. We
thought that no one would risk making a getaway
through the front door. I gave her Uncle Phineas’s
old gun and I took my rifle. Grandfather stayed in the
back of the house with his gun. Chris kept making a
steady round of the house, using Father’s gun. Chris
and I changed places—I was in the upper hall—from
three to four o’clock. At four, because she insisted,
and because we felt certain there was no danger by
that time, we allowed Aunt Gracia to make another
thorough search with Chris. Irene, who had come out
of Olympe’s room when Chris had started for Quilterville,
tagged along with him and Aunt Gracia on this
last search of theirs. Except for not whistling up Whatof
and Keeper, which did not occur to any of us until they
showed up for their breakfasts on Tuesday morning, I
can’t see that we overlooked a single bet. Can you?</p>

<p>Returning to our coffee-cup conversation, Grandfather
said, in answer to Aunt Gracia’s reply about
thinking: “I have been thinking myself, dear—or
attempting to do so. We have all been trying to think,
I fancy. I, too, have reached but one conclusion: that
constructive thinking is impossible for any of us, as
yet. Minds in the states that our minds are in just now
are illy working machines, Gracia. We’ll do well not to
rely on them, for the present.”</p>

<p>“No, Father,” Aunt Gracia actually said, “that won’t
do. Christopher is going, in a few minutes, to town
for the sheriff. Before he gets here, with other outsiders,
it is necessary for us to put our minds in order. Seven
people were in this house last night after Dick was
killed. No one could have left the house without making
footprints in the snow. There are no footprints. We
knew that in the night. This morning has proved it.
There are no footprints. Whether we are willing to admit
it or not, each one of us here knows that no one is
hiding in this house. That brings us to this, and evasion
is useless: One of us seven must be the person who
killed Dick.”</p>

<p>“Seven people, yes,” Grandfather said. “But seven
people all locked in their rooms. No judgment that does
not take into consideration those locked doors, is
sound.”</p>

<p>Aunt Gracia said, “Six people locked in their rooms.”</p>

<p>Judy, if she had smashed a bomb down on the dining
table she couldn’t have caused a worse explosion. I
don’t know what the others had thought about Irene
being out, wandering around alone in the halls at
midnight. I had not thought anything. I hadn’t had time
to give it a thought. Grandfather was right, as he always
is, about our minds being broken machines that night
and morning. Mine is yet, for that matter. I’d be crazy
if it weren’t for the order I was getting by writing this
all out to you.</p>

<p>Irene began a bout of violent hysteria, screeching
wedlock’s warcry at Chris: “I told you so! I told you
so!”</p>

<p>Chris lost his head completely. He cursed, and
banged the table with his fists, and shook his long
forefinger, arm’s length, at Aunt Gracia, and shouted.</p>

<p>Grandfather stood up, straight, at the head of the
table. Gosh, but he can tower! I’ll remember him like
that. He said to Chris, “Sir, restrain yourself, and
comfort and quiet your wife.” He turned to Aunt
Gracia. “Daughter, explain to me the meaning of your
last statement.”</p>

<p>“But I thought you knew, Father,” Aunt Gracia
said, “that Irene was not locked in her room last night.”</p>

<p>While Grandfather said: “I had not known that. I
had thought that Christopher had been the first to
succeed in opening his bedroom door, and that he had
sent Irene to release us while he stayed with Dick,” he
kept on towering. Then he put his palms flat on the
table and, slowly, sat down again in his chair.</p>

<p>Chris roared, “Uncle Thaddeus, are you going to sit
calmly there and allow Gracia to accuse my wife of
murder?”</p>

<p>Irene said: “She did it herself. That’s why she is
accusing me.”</p>

<p>Yes, Judith, this conversation took place on the Q 2
Ranch, in the year 1900.</p>

<p>By some blessed miracle, Grandfather did not hear
this speech of Irene’s. He spoke to Chris. “I think
Gracia made no such accusation, Christopher.” And to
Aunt Gracia, “You meant to make none, did you,
Daughter?”</p>

<p>“No,” Aunt Gracia answered. “I said, only, that
Irene was not locked in her room last night. That she
was in the hall, with the keys, and that she let us all
out of our rooms. I think that circumstance should be
explained.”</p>

<p>Chris started up a lot of con talk about his wife doing
no explaining. Grandfather said, “If you please,
Christopher?” and little Chris subsided.</p>

<p>“My dear,” Grandfather said to Irene, “if you will,
please tell us exactly what occurred last night with
reference to yourself. I ask for this, you all understand,
not as an explanation of Irene’s actions, but as a possible
means for helping us all forward toward the truth.”</p>

<p>Irene lifted her head from Chris’s padded shoulder
and looked first at Aunt Gracia and then at me. I felt
as if she were clawing those light blue eyes of hers into
my face. I thought: “She thinks I murdered Father,”
and looked up to see Grandfather following her stare.
I met his eyes. They didn’t claw, Judy. They did something
worse than that. Just for an instant, before they
looked away, they speculated—they doubted. You’ll
say I imagined that. All right. Remember the time we
tried lying to Grandfather about the Evans kids’
bobsled? Did we imagine that look, that time?</p>

<p>Say, Jude, wouldn’t it be horrible if a person could
do some vile thing and then, from the shock of it,
or something, forget about it right off? I mean—not
know that he had done it. But Lucy was right in my
room, within two minutes after we had heard the shot.</p>

<p>No matter. What I am trying to get to is Irene’s
story. This was the first time that any of us, except
Chris, I suppose, had heard it. That is why I have
waited to tell you. If I am to get this thing organized, at
all, I’ll have to keep the events in order as nearly as I
can.</p>

<p>I think I’ll step outside again, and get another whiff
or two of cold air before I begin on Irene’s story. I
don’t know how important it is, or may be. But I want
to present it to you as clearly as I can.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="ch12">

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<p>One thing I am bound to say for Irene: she was
eager to tell what she knew. Chris did not wish
her to tell. She insisted and got snaky with him for
trying to stop her.</p>

<p>She said that, on Monday night, she couldn’t sleep;
so she got up—she thought it was then about ten o’clock,
though she was not certain—put on her slippers and her
wrapper, took a candle, and went downstairs to the
sitting room. She said she was going to read, and she
was afraid a light in the bedroom would disturb Chris.
She said, also, that she was cold, and she thought the
fire might still be burning in the sitting-room fireplace.</p>

<p>The fire was burning. She mended it, lighted the
hanging lamp, and finished reading her book. She
thought that it was close around eleven o’clock when
she went upstairs again. The door to her room and
Chris’s was locked. She said that she and Chris had had
a “trifling quarrel” before Chris had gone to sleep. She
thought, in consequence, that he had misunderstood
her reason for leaving the room and had locked her out.
(That gives a fair notion of her perceptions. She’d been
married to Chris for seven months, and yet she could
fancy that he was capable of a cad’s trick such as that.
Chris is faulty, but he’s no mucker.) She said that this
made her very, very unhappy and a little bit angry.
She didn’t desire the family to know that Chris could
do such a thing; so without making a particle of noise,
she tiptoed downstairs again and made a bed for
herself on the sofa, with the Indian blankets.</p>

<p>Her next move was to pull the bolts on the doors to
the front and back stairways. She did that because, she
said, she felt sure Chris would feel ashamed of himself
before long and come down and try to make it up with
her. I guess she was pretty hot, all right, for she said
she thought the bolted doors would show him that two
could play at that lock-out game. Locked doors are
a mania of hers, anyway. So is insomnia, though she
sleeps until noon often enough. This trick of going
downstairs to read was, as far as I know, a new one
with her. I fancy the trifling quarrel was responsible
for that.</p>

<p>After she had locked the doors, she blew out the light,
got into her sofa bed, and settled for a long, comfortable
weeping spell. Or, as she explained it, she lay down
and cried herself to sleep.</p>

<p>She was wakened by the sound of the shot upstairs.
The room Father had then—Chris’s old room—is right
above the sitting room, you know. She said she thought
it was Chris shooting himself because she had been
unkind to him. (She is the sort of woman to whom such
an action would seem not merely reasonable but also
admirable.) She jumped from the sofa, got into her
wrapper and slippers, lighted her candle, ran through
the rooms, unbolted the door to the front stairway, and
ran upstairs. All the noises had begun up there, she
said, before she had got the door unbolted. If anyone
had been running through the upper hall, or trying to
come down the back stairway, there would have been
no chance of her having heard him.</p>

<p>She started straight down the hall for Chris’s and
her room. She says she is sure she did not get hold of
the idea, then, that we were all locked in our rooms.
She said that she did hear Grandfather shout, “Let
me out of here!” but she was too badly frightened to
make any meanings at all.</p>

<p>She passed Olympe’s room and Grandfather’s room
on her left, and Aunt Gracia’s, and yours, and Lucy’s
on her right before she came to Father’s door. It was
standing open. The light was burning, so she ran in
there. For the minute, and for the first time, too, she
had forgotten about the exchange of rooms.</p>

<p>She said that, when she saw Father lying there in
bed, it took her a minute to realize that he was not
Christopher. Father was lying with his head tipped back
on his pillows, and with blood streaming out over his
nightshirt. She ran to him. She put her candle on the
table there, and sort of lifted him in her arms. That
was when she got her wrapper smeared with blood. She
says he turned his eyes toward the open window and
murmured, “Got away.” At first, Irene was certain
that Father had said, “Got away.” But, when Aunt
Gracia questioned her, she admitted that Father spoke
indistinctly and that he might have said, “Go away.”
But I know that her best impression is that Father
said, “Got away.” Then, she declares that Father said,
quite distinctly, “Red mask.” There was no shaking
her certainty about that. She said that he used his lips
to say it, and that she was watching them, and that
she would swear that he said, “Red mask.”</p>

<p>It stands to reason, Judy, that Father did not say
“Red mask.” Now what could he have said that sounds
like red mask? Repeat it over to yourself. I have; but
I can’t get it. “Dead” sounds something like “red.”
“Dead past.” That’s senseless, isn’t it? “May ask,”
sounds like “mask,” and takes the lip pressure that
Irene insists he made. But “may ask” is meaningless,
isn’t it? I can’t get it. I am hoping that Lucy may be
able to, later. She is such a little word wizard.</p>

<p>Irene knew that Father was dying. She thought
that he had shot himself. She did not try to question
him. We can’t blame her for that. She wanted to do
something for him, but she didn’t know what to do.
She attempted to ease his position; to stop the flow
of blood with the sheets.</p>

<p>He said our names: “Neal. Judith. Lucy.” She started
to leave him, then, to bring Lucy and me to him. He
said, more loudly than he had spoken before: “Wait.
Father.” She ran back to him, and he said, slowly and
plainly: “Bring Father. I must tell <em>him</em>.” He repeated,
“Must tell Father.” That was the end.</p>

<p>Irene declares that there can be no doubt about it:
Father had something that he wished to tell Grandfather
and no one else. It seems to me that can mean
but one thing: Father knew who killed him. He was
willing to tell Grandfather, no one else, who that person
was. This would seem to preclude an outsider. Though
there may be still some events in Father’s past life of
which we children have not been informed.</p>

<p>That ends Irene’s story, in so far as Father is concerned.
She left him, then, and ran to the door and back
again to get her candle before going into the dark hall.
On the table, beside her candle, and in the light ring
from Father’s lamp, she saw the keys lying scattered.
Then, she thinks, for the first time she made the
connection of the noise in the hall with the doors. That
is reasonable enough—for Irene. She said she could
not get the keys picked up. She kept dropping them.
At last she put them in the pocket of her wrapper and,
with her candle, came into the hall. Lucy’s door is
directly across the hall from Father’s room, as you
know. Irene poked one of the keys into the lock and
unlocked it.</p>

<p>I asked her how she had known which key to use.
She said that she had never thought of that. She took
the keys from her pocket, one at a time, and each one
fitted the lock she put it in. That is straight. The locks
on the upstairs doors are all alike, and so are the keys.
Chris made me go with him Tuesday while he proved
this to me.</p>

<p>When Irene had finished telling her story, Tuesday
morning, Aunt Gracia asked her why she had unlocked
Lucy’s door first. She added that Lucy was the one child
in the household. It was stupid of Aunt Gracia to ask
that, because Irene had just told us how it had
happened. I didn’t blame Chris for getting hot.</p>

<p>He said Aunt Gracia was assuming that Irene ran
out of Father’s door in full possession of all her
faculties; that Irene was in a condition to stop and reason
quietly about which door it would be wise to open first,
establishing orders of precedence, giving us all a rating
as to age and importance. There was tragedy, Chris
said. There was a duty for Irene to perform. She
performed it, and she deserved high admiration for her
composure and courage. We might, or not, give her
that admiration, he said. But he would brook no word
of criticism.</p>

<p>In a way, I agree with Chris. I wish Irene had got us
out sooner; but I can see her position. Father was dying.
She felt as if she should do something for him, right
there, instead of rushing off and leaving him. When
she did start to leave him, he called her back to him—that
is, told her to wait. I don’t like Irene. But I guess
she did about as well as any of us younger ones would
have done.</p>

<p>Aunt Gracia seemed to pay no attention to Chris’s
speech. Her next question was downright crumby.
She asked Irene why she had thought Christopher had
shot himself, when she must have known that
Christopher had no gun.</p>

<p>Grandfather settled that in a hurry. He apologized
for Aunt Gracia; and then he explained to her that
sudden fright, as she knew, precluded rationalization,
and that it was natural that Irene’s first anxiety should
be for her husband.</p>

<p>Aunt Gracia said, “You haven’t a gun, have you,
Christopher?”</p>

<p>“Beginning already?” Chris was ugly about it. “No,
Gracia, I have no gun. Have you?”</p>

<p>Aunt Gracia said: “No, I haven’t. But that is an
honest question, and you had a right to ask it.”</p>

<p>“Irene,” Grandfather said, “Christopher and Gracia
were both locked in their rooms, were they not? You
unlocked both their doors?”</p>

<p>“I did, Uncle Thaddeus,” Irene answered. “I swear
that I released every member of this family from a
locked room.”</p>

<p>It seems to me like this, Judy. Either we have to
believe Irene’s story, all of it, or we have to disbelieve
it. I am here. I know her. I heard her tell it. I believe
it, word for word.</p>

<p>Grandfather believes it, I know. In spite of her actions,
I think that Aunt Gracia believes it. Or, perhaps
I should say, against her own will, I think Aunt Gracia
believes it. Chris must believe it. But here is the crumby
thing about Chris. Instead of saying flat, as I can say,
that he knows Irene’s story is true, he keeps trying to
prove it.</p>

<p>He got me off and showed me, on Tuesday, that the
fire had been mended after we left it the night before.
He showed me the oil in the hanging lamp, nearly
burned out. He has said, “Irene had no opportunity to
get rid of a revolver.” As if Irene could not have done
all the things she said she had done—built the fire,
burned the oil, made the bed, and then come upstairs
later and fired the shot. She could have hidden the gun
in the front of her wrapper, and have got rid of it
since. Nobody searched her. The only important thing
about any of Chris’s “proofs” for Irene is that he thinks
it necessary to hunt for them and use them.</p>

<p>On the square, though he is starring himself in the
rôle of sleuth, Chris seems to me to be more off his screw
than any of us. But, perhaps, I haven’t any right to
say that. Chris told me that I should try to brace up,
that Lucy, poor little kid, was worrying desperately
about me. Grandfather told me that we must be careful
for Aunt Gracia; that it seemed to him the tragedy
was affecting her more seriously than any of the rest of
us. Aunt Gracia thinks that Grandfather is harder hit
than any of us. And, of course, Olympe is still flat in bed.</p>

<p>It is queer about Olympe. She must have heard the
shot and jumped out of bed and fainted from fright.
But she has no memory of having heard it at all. That
shows the sort of tricks one’s memory can play. When
we found she didn’t know what had happened, we didn’t
tell her until Dr. Joe got here yesterday, Wednesday
morning. (I started this letter on Wednesday; but I’ve
written all night, so it is four o’clock Thursday morning
now.) Dr. Joe thought it better to break the news to
her gently than to have her keep on fussing and worrying
and asking questions. He told her. Leave it to Dr.
Joe to take for himself, and put right through, any old
disagreeable job that we are all afraid of attempting.</p>

<p>After our merry little breakfast on Tuesday morning,
Chris rode to Quilterville to spread the news, send the
telegram to Dr. Joe, and to send the crazy lying
telegram, which he and Irene had composed together, to
you.</p>

<p>Gus Wildoch and Hank Buckerman (he’s coroner
now) and a couple of other guys came out to the ranch
with Chris. Gus and Hank were as decent as they could
be, I guess, under the circumstances. The other guys
went about issuing invitations to have their faces
punched in; but again under the circumstances—how
handy those clichés are—I let them get away with it.</p>

<p>Grandfather took charge of Gus and Hank. Gus’s
attitude seemed to be that, if Grandfather would tell
him what he wanted done, he’d do it. They stayed
around about an hour, holding their sombreros like
stomachers and shaking their heads, and then they left.
Hank was much embarrassed because there would have
to be an inquest. He kept apologizing to Grandfather
about it. When Grandfather suggested that, perhaps,
the inquest could be discussed later, Hank said sure,
whenever we said, and, furthermore, it was nothing but
a damn lot of red tape anyway.</p>

<p>Gus and Hank came out again to the ranch when
Dr. Joe came, early Wednesday morning. Slim Hyde
came, too, with his hearse. Dr. Joe had brought him
because he, Dr. Joe, wished to take Father’s body to
Quilterville for an autopsy. Hank was a trifle worried
about the inquest by this time, but Dr. Joe told him
that the family would not be able to be bothered with
anything of the sort for several days. The time was
finally set for Friday morning. Queer, especially since
old Hank is coroner, how I dread that inquest. If I
were dog guilty, I couldn’t dread it much more than I
do. Hank was decent as could be about it. Insisted,
again, that it was a mere formality, and advised
Grandfather not to try to attend. Furthermore, he said, that
went for any of us who weren’t feeling up to snuff on
Friday morning. All he needed, he declared, were one
or two folks who could kind of tell a little about how
things had happened.</p>

<p>Hank himself, as I nearly forgot to tell you, deduced
a theory almost at once which satisfied him completely.
Someone, he declared, had shot Father through the
open window. Since it did not matter at all to Hank
that there is not a tree of any sort near Father’s room,
nor that, unless the murderer had been equipped with
wings, he should have had to stand on the porch roof
to fire, nobody bothered to quarrel with Hank about
it, nor about how the fellow had got the window
open, nor any of it.</p>

<p>Dr. Joe stayed here until shortly after noon. He had
his hands pretty full, what with attending the entire
family, and interviewing and dismissing the
busybodies who had been streaming up since the day
before, like ants to a sugar bowl.</p>

<p>Chris and I could not see much reason for an autopsy.
We knew that Father had been shot; and had died from
that shot. But Dr. Joe was as stubborn as a mule about
it; so we gave in. He and Slim took Father’s body to
Quilterville on Wednesday afternoon. It will stay there,
now, until after the inquest, and then be brought home
for the funeral, which, I believe, the folks have decided
to have on Saturday.</p>

<p>I have kept at this all night, in order that you and I
can start even. I want you to know, when you have
read this letter, as much as I knew when I wrote it.
I’ll skip through it now and see whether I have left
out any points. If not, I’ll ride into Quilterville, as
soon as Chris gets up at six, and mail this on number
Twenty-two.</p>

<p>I find several points I have not made in connection
with Irene’s story. As soon as she had heard the shot,
she came through the downstairs rooms and up the
front stairway. The door was locked, until she unlocked
it. No one could have come downstairs the front way
then, or she would have met him. The door to the back
stairs was also locked, on the sitting-room side.
Someone could have run down the hall and have hidden on
the back stairway, or in the bathroom, which was
unlocked. Someone could have gone to the attic. The door
to the attic was unlocked. Then, while we were all in
Father’s room, just at the first there, he might have
managed to sneak through the hall, which was dark,
and past Father’s door in spite of the fact that it was
open, and get to some hiding place without any of us
seeing him. Whatever his previous plans had been, they
had not included one member of the family, not locked
in a room, who could unlock the other doors. Nor, of
course, had his plans included the circumstance of his
being locked upstairs by means of the bolted stairway
doors.</p>

<p>I know how this will be bound to seem to you: the
problem was one of discovering some fellow hiding
in the house. It would seem so to me, I am sure, if I
were not right here. Judy, you’ll have to take my word
for it. No one was hiding in this house on Monday
night or Tuesday morning. A human being, even a
child, takes a good-sized space to hide in. There was not
a foot of space, from cellar to attic, which we had not
gone over with idiotic thoroughness before it was
light on Tuesday morning.</p>

<p>I can see you sitting there and thinking of places
where we did not look. It won’t go, dear. Yes, we looked
in the old furnace and poked into it, though Lucy could
not have crawled into the fire box. Yes, we have looked
in the broom closets and the fruit closets. We have
looked in the flour and sugar bins, and the wash boilers,
and the churns, and the bureau drawers. We have
looked as if we were hunting for a collar button instead
of a man. And, remember, Aunt Gracia at the time,
and since, has been over every square inch of the house.
You know that she can always find any missing thing
in this house more easily than we can find a word in the
dictionary. Irene, I think it was—it sounds like her—who
suggested secret passages and sliding panels. They
would be convenient, wouldn’t they?</p>

<p>The ground is still covered with snow. Except for the
paths from the front and back doors, and the necessary
paths to the barns and outhouses, and the tracks the
dogs have made, the snow, as far as we can see, is clean
and unbroken. That would mean, wouldn’t it, that
anyone who had left the house since Monday night had
left it through the front or the back door? No one has
stepped on the side porch, and the snow from that
door to the yard is still unbroken. We could not keep
the paths from getting beaten—people coming and
going, all that. We have kept the outside doors locked,
and Chris has the keys in his pocket. Nobody could
pick those locks with a hairpin or a glove buttoner. We
have kept Whatof chained by the front door and
Keeper chained by the back door. You know, when
those dogs have been told to watch, what they would
do to some sneaking stranger.</p>

<p>After this, it hardly seems worth while to bother about
telling you what Chris discovered when he was looking
under Father’s bed that night. But here it is. The bed
had been moved three or four inches at the foot—pulled
along over the carpet, I mean, as if some fairly hefty
weight had been tugging on it. Chris keeps declaring
that this must be of importance. How can it be
important? Remember, the rope was covered with snow. The
snow on the window sill and on the porch roof was
unbroken. The snow makes it a certainty that no one had
got out of that window during the past hour, let alone
the past twenty minutes. Chris maunders about the rope
having been used for some purpose before the
snowstorm began. Irene suggested that the fellow might
have come in that way. Lassoed the leg of the bed, first,
I suppose, and then climbed right up.</p>

<p>I think that finishes it all then, except this. The folks
here, for some reason, seem to be getting comfort from
keeping you and Greg in the dark. Rather often
somebody pauses to thank goodness that you two don’t
have to know the truth. I am not asking you to lie for
me; but, on the level, I wish you would. Things are bad
enough around here as it is, without having the folks
all sore at me. In time, they will have to tell you the
truth. If you could, until they get ready to do so,
receive whatever hanky-panky they write to you, and not
let them know that you are on, it would help me a lot.</p>

<p>I’ll write you the truth every night—I’m night herding
in the house at present. You can write what you
please to me, of course. As I have said, I need the
benefit of your thinking. Too, and again of course, you can
do as you please about giving me away. Perhaps I
would better say, you can do what you have to do. It
doesn’t matter, really. What does?</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="dateline-day">Thursday night,</p>
<p class="dateline">October 11, 1900.</p>

<p><span class="sal">Dear Judy:</span>
I said I’d write again to-night, so
I shall, though I haven’t much to add to what I
wrote last night. All day I’ve been troubled with
doubts about the wisdom of this writing. But I have
started it, and you’ll want the developments, and I
need your help; so I’ll keep at it for a while, at any rate.
Particularly, I am sure, you will want news of the
family.</p>

<p>They are all saying, now, how splendidly Grandfather
is coming through. He has got the cane that
Chris duded with in the East, and he totters about
with it, defying any one of us to think that he needs
to use it. Physically, he is a dead game sport. But,
mentally, darn it, Judy, I don’t know. Think this over.
Is it like Grandfather to insist, in spite of everything,
to insist without rhyme or reason, that someone
sneaked in from the outside and killed Father, and got
away again? No, sir, it is not like him. But that is what
he is saying. I have decided that either Grandfather does
think that I did it, and is putting up this con talk to
save me, or else that, mentally, Grandfather has
weakened a bit.</p>

<p>That brings the interesting speculation as to whether
or not Grandfather would try to save me. I know this
about him. He is the finest, straightest, wisest man I
have ever known. (If Father had lived, he would have
been as great as Grandfather, in the end. But
Grandfather had an edge on Father of thirty-odd years of
living, and experiencing, and acquiring knowledge and
wisdom.) Giving that character to Grandfather—or to
any man—would he, if he felt fairly certain that his
grandson had killed his own father, even by mistake
for another man, try to cover traces, shield him, and
allow him to go free? I think that he would. You know,
Grandfather has always been strong for the idea of
usefulness connected with morality and the principle
of the greatest good for the greatest number. He would
think that, by saving me from punishment, he was
saving the entire family from worse punishment. While
my punishment would be a just one, theirs would be
fearfully unjust. The family name would be disgraced.
You and Lucy would be known as the sisters of a
murderer—a parricide. Your children—had an uncle
hanged. No, Grandfather would not stick that. A few
months ago he wrote for Lucy, “Be generous, rather
than just.” That is what he would do. He would let
justice slide for me in order to be generous to the rest
of the family. He would save me in order to save our
standards, our traditions, and the other Quilters’
futures. And any one of us would do the same thing. I
know it.</p>

<p>Olympe is still in bed. She quite simply lies there. I
went in and talked to her a few minutes to-day. Unless
the family stops this darn sentimental business of everyone
trying to “spare” everyone else, we’ll make a fine
showing on Friday at the inquest. I asked Olympe,
straight, how she supposed it had happened that
Uncle Phineas’s old gun was under her when the ladies
picked her up from the floor.</p>

<p>She said that, since I was asking for suppositions, she
supposed she had seized it—Olympe would never do less
than “seize” a gun—and jumped from her bed before
she fainted. It seems, when Uncle Phineas is away, that
she always sleeps with his old gun under her pillow.</p>

<p>I told her that it had been unloaded. She said she
knew it. She would have been afraid to sleep with the
horrible, dangerous thing beneath her pillow if it were
not unloaded.</p>

<p>Olympe’s guns would always be unloaded, wouldn’t
they? As if her life were nothing but motions—useless
things pretending usefulness; unrealities in the guise
of reality. Her world is a stage, right enough, and she
is more merely a player than it seems entirely moral
for any living person to be.</p>

<p>She said she supposed it must have been the sound
of the shot that frightened her, though she does not
remember having heard the shot. (Dr. Joe says that is
not at all unusual. That, often, when people faint from
sudden fright, they do not remember the cause of their
fright when they regain consciousness.) The last things
that Olympe remembers are rubbing lotion on her
hands, getting into bed, and blowing out the lamp on
her bedside table.</p>

<p>I think that her prostration now is by way of being
distinctive. Sorry. That is a crumby way for me to write
of Olympe. I am tremendously fond of her, and she
knows it.</p>

<p>Aunt Gracia is doing only fairly well. She looks ill.
Her grief has intensified her aloofness. Grief is the first
word to use; but it is grief plus horror with Aunt Gracia.
She is convinced that some one of us, right here in the
house now, murdered Father on Monday night. As
always, she manages to be the most useful member of
the family. She would die for any one of us, I believe;
but she hates to live with us—excepting, of course,
Grandfather and Lucy.</p>

<p>Lucy, poor little kid, is hit hard. She is up and around,
and she helps Aunt Gracia. But she looks—frightful.
You’d hardly know her. That shocked expression is
still on her face, sort of stuck on it, like a mask. She
was too skinny, anyway, and I’ll bet she has lost ten
pounds since Monday night. She doesn’t cry. She slips
about, working, or staying close to Grandfather. She
has stopped reading. She has stopped writing. When
she isn’t busy with the little duties Aunt Gracia finds
for her, she huddles close to Grandfather—Chris
says—or, when I am in the house, to me, and sits quietly
with her tiny hands in her lap, and with that expression
on her face. She took a tablet early this evening and
began to write to you. She wrote about half a page,
and then she walked across the room and tossed the
entire tablet into the fire. I know why. Lucy will not
write lies. She cannot write the truth. So she has
quit.</p>

<p>Irene and Chris, I think, have come through better
than the rest of us. Irene dared to say that she and
Christopher still had their “great love.” All the rest of
us, Aunt Gracia and Grandfather, Lucy and I, for
instance, hate one another, I suppose. I should not
suggest, though, that Irene is not affected, or that Chris
is not. Irene cries most of the time. She is as shaky as
an aspen, and hurt-seeming. She is not withdrawn, as
Aunt Gracia is; but, poor girl, she gives the impression
of trying to keep out of the way. I suppose grief is the
most jealous and the most selfish of all emotions, and
Irene senses it, even from Chris. We have no reason to
expect her to feel as we feel, now; and since she cannot
she is excluded and alone.</p>

<p>It is hard to write about Chris, or to understand him.
He loved Father. He has something to endure that the
rest of us haven’t—remorse. He made the last few
months of Father’s life a hell on earth for him, and he
knows it. When Chris thinks about our loss—he is
white all the way through. But Chris, like the rest of
us, has gone rather flooey. Judy, there is no good
denying it—Chris is scared. And fear seems to make Chris
rather yellow. I think it often does that to men and
women.</p>

<p>Chris had got it into his head that, sooner or later,
Irene is going to be blamed for this, because she was the
only one who was not locked in a room on Monday
night. So Chris has turned sleuth. An objectionable rôle
at best, and one that Chris plays badly. On the square,
Judy, it is a case of protesting too much. As nearly
as I can judge, the one thing against Irene is her
husband’s eagerness to prove that she is innocent.
Everyone here except Chris knows that she is, without
proof. I tried to give that to Chris to-day, but he would
not have it.</p>

<p>He said it was charming of the family, but that
after the inquest the law might step in. If it did, or
when it did, he thought it would be well to have some
proofs a bit more tangible, if less beautiful, than sweet
family faith.</p>

<p>He has been rounding up these proofs of his since
Monday night. If he has captured anything that is
worth a cent for proof of anything, he has not informed
me. This is the sort of thing he produces:</p>

<p>The rope—his informant was Aunt Gracia—had been
in the attic for a year or more. It was bought to be
used for a clothes-line. It was too thick for the clothespins
to straddle, so it was put in the attic. This fact,
that the rope was taken from our attic, Chris professes
to believe is of enormous import. Remember little
sentimental Lucy, aged four, when Uncle Phineas sneaked
her off to the circus, inquiring as she watched the clown,
“If he weren’t tho thad, would he be funny?”</p>

<p>To-day, Chris has been directing his attention to the
question of who locked us all in our rooms. I told him
that meant, merely, that he was directing his attention
to who murdered Father. Any boob would know that
whoever did the one thing did the other. He essayed
shrewdness with his “Perhaps.”</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p class="dateline">Later on Thursday night.</p>

<p>As I finished writing that last paragraph Aunt
Gracia came into the sitting room. I think she suspects
that I am giving you the truth, though she neither
accuses nor questions. She had brought some darning
with her, and for the first time since Tuesday morning
she seemed to wish to talk. So I have put this aside for
an hour, and we have been talking.</p>

<p>It is Chris, I suppose, who has started Aunt Gracia
to worrying about the locked doors. She asked me if
it didn’t seem strange to me that anyone could have
gone through the upper hall, locking all the doors,
and not have waked any of us.</p>

<p>I told her, perhaps a bit, but not very strange. She
and Lucy and I sleep like stones and always have.
Olympe is slightly deaf. Chris is a sound sleeper, too;
and if he had heard someone monkeying around he
would have thought it was Irene. Irene, downstairs,
with the doors closed and locked, couldn’t have heard
anyone who was trying to be quiet in the upper hall.</p>

<p>“That is all very well,” she said, “but what about
your grandfather? Do you think that anyone could
open his door, remove the key from the inside lock,
close the door and lock it on the outside, without his
hearing a sound? He sleeps like an Indian.”</p>

<p>“For that matter,” I said, “Father slept lightly, too.
But the doors were locked, and no one heard it being done.
Why bother with conjectures when we have facts?”</p>

<p>She declared that we had no facts, as yet. She said
that I was wrong about Father sleeping lightly. That is,
he had not been sleeping lightly of late, because there
was something to make him sleep heavily in the medicine
Dr. Joe had been prescribing for him. She said she
meant to talk to Dr. Joe about that, later. Just now, she
wished to talk to me about the locked doors.</p>

<p>“What I believe,” she said, “is that the keys for the
doors were collected sometime early in the evening, or,
perhaps, in the afternoon. Then, when the murderer
slipped through the hall that night he had nothing to
do but fit the keys into the locks and turn them. It is
possible that Father would not have heard so slight
a sound as that. It is not possible that anyone could
have opened his door without his hearing it. Not one of
us, I think, except Irene would have noticed if our key
was not in its lock when we went to bed. Not one of us
used our bedroom key, except Irene.”</p>

<p>“Was her key in the lock when she went to bed?” I
asked.</p>

<p>Aunt Gracia said, “I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you ask her?” I suggested.</p>

<p>“I have asked her.”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t she remember? Or wouldn’t she tell you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, she told me. She said that it was not in the
lock. She said she missed it, at once, and told
Christopher that it was gone. He said, no matter—something
of the sort.”</p>

<p>“Well, Aunt Gracia?” I asked. I guess she could
see the chip on my shoulder. I don’t like Irene a bit
better than Aunt Gracia likes her. But I seem to like
fair play a lot better than Aunt Gracia does.</p>

<p>“Well,” she sort of mocked, “since the key was missing
at nine o’clock, doesn’t it seem odd to you that
when, at eleven or thereabouts, Irene found the door
locked against her, she should have decided that
Christopher had locked her out?”</p>

<p>“Not at all,” I said. “She was angry, and her feelings
were hurt. Why should she stop to wonder about the
key? The door was locked, wasn’t it? Irene and I seem,
at least, to have a feeling for facts in common. The door
was locked. All right—Chris could have got up, found
the key, and locked it, couldn’t he? Keys aren’t
stationary things.”</p>

<p>“Evidently not,” Aunt Gracia said, without lifting
her eyes from her sewing. “I’ve asked everyone but
you, Neal. No one can say whether his key was on the
inside or outside of his lock, that night, or whether it
was missing entirely. Do you know about the key to
your door?”</p>

<p>I didn’t, of course. I hadn’t touched the thing since
she had put it in the lock, weeks ago.</p>

<p>“No one,” she said, “in this house, ever touched
keys, or thought keys, but Irene. Understand, Neal,”
she went on quickly, because, I think, she saw that her
injustice was making me hot, “I do not think that Irene
walked into Dick’s room on Monday night and shot him.
I do know this. We all know it. Irene was out in the hall
that night, with the keys to all the doors. She could
lock or unlock as she chose. She could have locked us
all in our rooms. She could have spent the ten minutes
or so, after we heard the shot, in Dick’s room with
him as she says she did, or she could have spent that
time in helping someone to escape, or hide, or——(Dick’s
last words, as quoted by Irene, particularly the ‘red
mask’ remark, did not carry conviction to me. Did they
to you?) Then, when she was certain that her—shall we
say friend?—her friend was safe, she could have
unlocked our doors. Lucy’s first—the child of the
household.</p>

<p>“Fine!” I said. “Except that no one was hidden in
the house, and that no one has escaped. Irene unlocked
Lucy’s door because it was straight in front of
her as she ran from Father’s room. If, as you’ve been
hinting, Irene had planned with somebody to kill
Father, would she have agreed to a plan that would
put her in the position she is in now—that is, the only
one of us who was not locked in a room?”</p>

<p>“Irene is stupid. She might have agreed blindly,
if the person who did the planning was clever. But
there is this, Neal. I repeat, I insist that Irene is
stupid. Suppose, this seems more probable, that whoever
planned to kill Dick did not tell Irene the truth
about what he was planning to do. Suppose he made her
believe that something else—no, I have no idea what—was
going to be done that night. The rope might come
into it there. And the snow probably spoiled some extra
plan. No one could have reckoned on snow in October.
In all my memory, snow in October has come just once
before this—that was when I was a little girl. In other
words, suppose that Irene helped, but unwittingly—as
a dupe, a cat’s-paw. That is possible, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“No,” I said. “Irene couldn’t keep a secret to save
her life. If she had got mixed up in this, but was innocent
of any wrong intentions, she would have told Chris,
either purposely or by mistake. It takes stouter stuff
than Irene has to keep a secret at a time like this. If
she had told Chris anything of that sort, he would have
told us. You may, or may not, have a right to doubt
Irene’s honesty. You can’t doubt Chris’s—not in an
affair of this sort.”</p>

<p>“I can,” Aunt Gracia said. “I do. I doubt everyone
in this house, for one reason or another, except your
Grandfather and, perhaps, Lucy.”</p>

<p>That “perhaps” made me see red. “And yourself?”
I said. I was a mucker for saying it as I did.</p>

<p>She answered me quietly: “No. Sometimes I doubt
myself.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” I said, “but you can stop doubting
Lucy, here and now——”</p>

<p>“I have never thought,” Aunt Gracia interrupted,
“that Lucy walked into Dick’s room and shot him.
Don’t be absurd, Neal.”</p>

<p>“Whatever you thought about her,” I said, “makes
no particular difference. She was in my room within
two minutes, within a minute, I should say, after the
shot was fired. If you could have seen her then——”
I was too sore to try to talk about it.</p>

<p>“Yes. I knew about her coming directly into your
room, Neal,” was what Aunt Gracia said with words.</p>

<p>I got up and put a log on the fire. I didn’t dare trust
myself to answer her.</p>

<p>After a minute or two, she went on talking. She
wished that I would stop standing up for Irene. She
said that it didn’t matter what I said to the family;
but, when outsiders, people in authority, came to
question me, she thought it unnecessary for me to
make my defences of Irene so angrily and so staunchly.
She finished by saying: “You don’t like her, Neal. You
have never liked her. You have said to me that you
hated her. Why should you, now, take this attitude
toward her? You resent even her husband’s attempts to
prove her story—resent them on the grounds that
Irene never could, under any provocation, do an
unworthy deed.”</p>

<p>“Rot!” I said. “Look here, there is a difference
between an unworthy deed, as you say, and murder—or
even helping a murderer along.”</p>

<p>“To be sure,” she said.</p>

<p>I decided to answer her, this time. “Do you believe,”
I said, “that I murdered Father, and that Irene
helped me?”</p>

<p>“I think,” she answered, straight, “that Irene had
to help either you, or Christopher, or Olympe—or
someone from the outside who has eluded us. My clear
thinking forces me to give up hope of an outsider. You
notice that I have left out Father, myself, and Lucy.
The madness of the past few days has, sometimes, made
me almost doubt myself; but I know that is
madness—nothing else. No one could doubt Father, or
Lucy—I suppose.”</p>

<p>“All right, Aunt Gracia,” I answered—I can’t explain
it, but her saying that she had had moments of
doubting herself was mighty good for me to hear—“let’s
look at it this way. What reason would Chris, or
Olympe, or you—let’s include you—or I have for
killing Father? I mean, why would any one of us have
done it?”</p>

<p>“Why does anyone ever murder?” she asked.
“Because, since his mind his not become one with his
Creator’s mind, he can lose it—can be insane for a
longer or shorter time. Why did Dick murder Enos
Karabass?”</p>

<p>“Because he tried to assault Mother,” I answered.</p>

<p>“So Dick said, and, I suppose—believed. Enos loved
me. He worshipped me, I tell you. I loved—worshipped
him. Our punishment came because we did worship
each other, instead of our Creator. But, loving me as he
did, and loving all women because of me, do you
suppose—— Oh, how mad of me to talk to you like this!
No matter. I will say it. Dick was insanely, wildly
jealous. You are Dick’s son. But vengeance is the Lord’s.
If you did do this thing, I hope you may go free, as
Dick went free; and that, before you die, you may be
saved, forgiven, and ready to enter one of the highest
states of glory, as Dick was ready.”</p>

<p>I don’t know why that didn’t make me hot. It didn’t.
It was as if I’d had a curtain over a part of my mind,
and Aunt Gracia’s accusation had drawn it aside, and
had shown me, in the light, that the dim, queer things
I had sort of halfway feared myself, were—cobwebs.</p>

<p>My own relief, I suppose, made me capable of sympathy
for her. I was dead sorry for her, and her doubts,
and her poor, battered-up love affair. I tried to say
what I thought might comfort her.</p>

<p>“It was a wonderful thing, Aunt Gracia,” I proffered,
“that, if Father had to die, he should have died so
soon after his baptism. That he could go, as you say,
saved, forgiven, and ready for one of the highest states
of glory——”</p>

<p>She interrupted me sharply: “Why do you talk to me
like that? You don’t believe any of it, and I know that
you don’t. What are you trying to do? Trap me?”</p>

<p>“Trap you?” I echoed like a fool. I didn’t get her at
all. You know how I am, Judy. I can use the old bean
all right, but it takes time—plenty and plenty of time.
Mark Twain, wasn’t it, who said, “When in doubt,
tell the truth?” I tried it. “I was attempting to
comfort you, dear,” I said.</p>

<p>“No, you weren’t,” she rewarded me. “But you have.
You have made me remember. Sometimes I forget.
What you have just said is the meaning of it all. That
is why I can endure it. Anything that has a meaning
can be endured.”</p>

<p>She went away quickly, and left me alone. I have
been sitting here, trying to think.</p>

<p>“Trap me,” she said. Can you beat it, Judy? You see
her meaning, don’t you? Chris, as a sleuth, has done
much talking about motives. If Aunt Gracia had wished
to be sure that Father would attain one of those highest
states of her glory——— You see? Before Father had had
time to backslide. A motive for Aunt Gracia. But who
would ever have thought of it but Aunt Gracia
herself?</p>

<p>Isn’t she the queerest proposition? Just when we get
to thinking that she is almost loony, she snaps around
on us and is brighter than we are. No mind that was
not in excellent working condition could have caught
me up like that, “What are you trying to do? Trap me?”
in half a second.</p>

<p>Though, as you know, Judy, all this is rot. Suppose
we got about it as Chris has been going of late. Suppose
we try to put salt on the tails of nonexistent clues, and
to materialize what Chris chooses to call “proofs” out
of the air.</p>

<p>Aunt Gracia’s voice was the one Lucy and I heard
first, and all the time on Monday night, calling and
calling to Grandfather from behind her locked door.
Aunt Gracia has lived a good many years now with
one of her high states of glory as her own objective.
Would she sacrifice it for Father’s sake? She would
not. If she had been guilty, would she have revealed her
motive, offhand, to me? She would not. All this, you
understand, would be Chris’s “proofs.” Mine would be
that I know Aunt Gracia. That I have known her all
my life. That she is a Quilter—Grandfather’s daughter
and Father’s sister. These are good enough proofs for
me.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="dateline-day">Friday night,</p>
<p class="dateline">October 12, 1900.</p>

<p><span class="sal">Dear Judy:</span>
We have been all day in Quilterville,
attending the coroner’s inquest. It was
pretty bad. Worse than I had expected. Hank Buckerman
was all right, decent as could be. But a fly guy
from the district attorney’s office was there, trying to
show off—make a name for himself; Lord only knows
what he was trying to do besides chivy us. His name is
Benjamin Thopson. He put the screws on, right enough.</p>

<p>The men on the jury were John Skrope, Roy Ulander,
George Houndel, Pete Garret, and a couple of
Swedes that have just bought the livery stable Jim
Murtaine used to have, down near the river. It was the
Swedes, I’ll bet, who kept the jury out so long. Two
hours and ten minutes, Jude, while we hung around
waiting, before they brought in their verdict: Died on
the night of October eighth, from the results of a
gunshot wound inflicted by person or persons unknown.</p>

<p>None of us said so while we were waiting. None of us
has said so yet. But I know what I was afraid of, and
I know what the others were afraid of: a verdict against
Irene, or against Irene and Chris together. That is
what they would have handed us, Jude, just as sure as
I’m living to tell it, if it had not been for Aunt Gracia.
But I must tell you that later. It is early evening now.
I have all night to write in. I want to give you the thing
straight, from beginning to end.</p>

<p>I had never been in that courtroom before, and I
know you have never been there. It is a dirty, dark
hole of a place, with the windows too high and the
ceiling too low. They kept the windows shut, and the
big coal stove in the centre of the room blazing away,
red hot all the way around part of the time, and eating
up the air.</p>

<p>Hank, looking like a good-humoured eagle, sat up
behind a desk where the judge sits during trials. This
smart aleck Thopson and Bruno Ward—the Portland
lawyer, you know, whom Father and Dr. Joe have
been consulting since Mr. White died—and Mattie
Blaine sat at a long table below and in front of Hank’s
desk. (Mattie had to take the whole works down in
shorthand.) We Quilters sat together in a front seat,
to the side. The remainder of the room was filled,
chiefly, with canaille. While I was in the witness chair
I had a chance to size up our audience. I was pleased
to see how many people we knew had enough good
taste and tact to stay away. None of the Beckers were
there, and none of the Youngs. Chris said Tod Eldon
was there with his wife, but I didn’t see them. None of
the Binghams were there. But a quarter section of the
room was filled with the Dunlapper tribe.</p>

<p>Dr. Joe testified first. Death was caused by an
intrathoracic hemorrhage, due to a bullet shot into the
left chest. The bullet entered the left chest between
the fifth and sixth ribs, pierced the pericardium without
injury to the heart, traversed the lung, and lodged
near the left scapula. (I’ve got this from Dr. Joe since
then.)</p>

<p>Thopson asked, “Any possibility of suicide, Dr.
Elm?”</p>

<p>Dr. Joe said, none. The absence of a weapon proved
that suicide was impossible. Also, absence of powder
burns showed that the gun had been fired from a
distance of several feet.</p>

<p>Thopson asked Dr. Joe whether he knew what sort
of gun had been used. Dr. Joe told him that he had
recovered the bullet. That it had been fired, evidently,
from a .38 calibre Colt’s.</p>

<p>Thopson said: “You were present in the house at the
time of the murder, Dr. Elm? You were among the first
to discover the body?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Dr. Joe.</p>

<p>“Your testimony, then, regarding the absence of a
weapon near the bedside, was given from hearsay?”</p>

<p>Dr. Joe said, “If Dick had had a gun in his hand when
they found him, the absence of powder burns, and the
position of the bullet, and the whole thing would prove
that he couldn’t have shot himself—if that’s what you’re
getting at.”</p>

<p>Thopson said he was through with the witness.
Hank excused Dr. Joe and called Irene to the stand.</p>

<p>The procedure, after that, was to call the witness,
swear him or her in, ask the name in full, where they
lived, what the relationship was to the victim, that
sort of thing, and then Hank would say, “Tell the
jury what you know about the shooting.”</p>

<p>Irene seemed delicate, and pretty, and out of place
stuck up there in that dirty old hole.</p>

<p>She told her story straight, just as she had told it
to us at home. Except she said that, when she found
the door locked she thought that Chris was trying to
play a joke on her. She omitted their quarrel, you
see—good job, too—and the part about having cried herself
to sleep.</p>

<p>Thopson led off by asking, “Is your husband in the
habit of locking you out of your room at night, for a
joke?”</p>

<p>Irene said, “No, he isn’t.”</p>

<p>“How many times has he locked you out?”</p>

<p>“He has never locked me out.”</p>

<p>“What gave you the idea, then, that it was a joke?”</p>

<p>Irene said, “It could have been nothing else.”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t a joke, though, in the end, was it?”</p>

<p>“It proved not to be. It also proved not to have been
my husband who had locked the door.”</p>

<p>“It never occurred to you to knock on your own door
and find out why your husband was—er—playing this
joke on you?”</p>

<p>“I did not wish to disturb the family.”</p>

<p>“Very considerate. A light rap, with a dainty hand,
on your own door, would have aroused and disturbed
the entire family, you think?”</p>

<p>Mr. Ward jumped up. “Mr. Coroner,” he said, “this
is a deliberate baiting of the witness, and a waste of
time. This lady has explained that, though she thought
the locked door was a joke, she was not entirely in
sympathy with it. Mr. Thopson questions because she
did not pound on the door like a vixen. It depends, I
suppose, upon one’s experience with ladies. This lady
slipped quietly away, arranged, as she has told us, a
neat little retaliation, and went to sleep.”</p>

<p>I had thought that Dr. Joe was making a sucker play
when he had got Mr. Ward to come over from Portland.
I changed my mind. Mr. Ward wasn’t particularly
brilliant, not one, two, three compared to Aunt Gracia,
but he was as useful as a left leg. Whenever this fly
Thopson would get too smart, Mr. Ward would jump
up and appeal to Hank, and Hank would shut Thopson
off. Then, if Thopson started hollering about it, Hank
would inquire: “What’s eating you, say? This ain’t a
trial.”</p>

<p>Perhaps it wasn’t a trial. But it came too close to
being one to suit me. Though, in another way, a real
trial might have been better. Right at the beginning, if
Mr. Ward could have defended Irene, it would, at least,
have carried the enormous advantage of straight dealing.
He couldn’t defend Irene, because no one had accused
her. What he was fighting was the accusation.
But he had to hide even that.</p>

<p>He played the rope, which the fiend had been afraid
to use, and the weapon that the fiend had carried
away with him, hard and fast. The trouble, or the chief
trouble was, I think, that he did not believe in them
himself.</p>

<p>Thopson chivied Irene, next, on what he called “the
victim’s last words.”</p>

<p>Irene had told that Father had said, “Got away,”
and then, “Red mask.”</p>

<p>“You think the victim meant to indicate that some
person, wearing a red mask, had got away?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what the words indicated. I only know
that he said them.”</p>

<p>“You have, perhaps, thought of some other meaning
that the words were meant to convey?”</p>

<p>“No, I have not.”</p>

<p>“You have given the matter no thought whatever?”</p>

<p>Mr. Ward stopped that. He asked whether the purpose
of this investigation was to discover the facts of
the case or to allow Mr. Thopson to torture a grief-stricken
lady. He said that, clearly, Richard Quilter’s
last words had meant to indicate that the man who
had murdered him had been masked, and had escaped.
Knowing, Mr. Ward said, that the family’s chief future
concern would be to apprehend the fiend who had
committed this heinous crime, Richard Quilter had, in
spite of the fact that he was a dying man, done his best
to aid his dear ones with the frightful task which he
knew, even then, would soon devolve upon them. “His
duty, first, gentlemen, though Richard Quilter
performed it from the edge of the grave. Duty done, he
called for his children, for his aged father——” On and
on. But Ward was no fool. Remember, Judy, the men
who were on the jury. Ward was merely heating his
wind for the shorn lambs, as it were; or, at least, that
was the way I sized him up.</p>

<p>Thopson asked Mr. Ward, directly, if he thought that
red masks were the customary apparel for murderers.</p>

<p>Mr. Ward said, “Dying men don’t lie, Mr. Thopson.”</p>

<p>Thopson said, “No. Dying men do not.”</p>

<p>But I think that went high over the heads of the jury.</p>

<p>Thopson then began on the keys. How had Irene
happened to see them there on the table?</p>

<p>“They were directly under the lamp and beside the
candlestick I had put down.”</p>

<p>“And what gave you the assurance that those
particular keys were the keys to the bedroom doors?”</p>

<p>“Nothing gave me that assurance. At last I understood
what the noise in the hall must have meant—was
meaning, that the others were locked in their rooms. I
saw keys there. I took the keys and went to unlock
the doors.”</p>

<p>“Very well. How long would you say it was from the
time you heard the shot until you happened to see the
keys on the table, put them into your pocket, and went
and unlocked the doors?”</p>

<p>“The others say it was about ten minutes—or a bit
longer—after the shot was heard, before I unlocked the
first door.”</p>

<p>“I am not asking you what the others say. I am
asking you for your own opinion.”</p>

<p>“I should have thought it was longer than that.”</p>

<p>“Time passed slowly, dragged, between the time of
the shot and the time to unlock the doors?”</p>

<p>Irene didn’t get it. I think the jury didn’t, either.</p>

<p>“It seemed a long time,” she answered.</p>

<p>“During this long time,” Thopson said, “did you
make any search, near the bed, for the weapon you
thought the victim had used to kill himself?”</p>

<p>“No. I was very much frightened and shocked. I
did not know what to do.”</p>

<p>“Were any weapons—any guns, that is—discovered
later in the house?”</p>

<p>“Dick’s own gun was in the closet of his room. But
the closet was a long distance from the bed. The gun
was on a high shelf, behind some boxes, and it was
found fully loaded.”</p>

<p>“That was the only gun in the house?”</p>

<p>“No. There were others. But they were all locked in
the rooms with the people who were locked in.”</p>

<p>“Through with witness,” Thopson said, and sat
down.</p>

<p>They called me next, swore me in, and so on.</p>

<p>I told my story; just about what I have written to
you, though in less detail. How I had heard the shot,
jumped out of bed, tried the door—— I was scared
stiff, Jude. I thought, after what Thopson had given
Irene, when she was a lady and a pretty one, there was
no imagining what he might do to me. When I stopped
talking and he said he was through with me, and Hank
said, “Witness excused,” I was so amazed that I kept
right on sitting there until he said again, “Witness
excused.”</p>

<p>They called for Lucy, next. But Grandfather had not
allowed her to come. He said that it was no place for
her, that she was not physically fit to go through with
anything of the sort, and that, since someone must
stay at home with Olympe, Lucy should stay.</p>

<p>Mr. Ward said, “Mr. Coroner, Lucy Quilter, a little
girl, twelve years old, ill herself from shock and grief,
is not in the courtroom. I may add that she is at home
attending her aunt, who is seriously indisposed.”</p>

<p>“And furthermore,” Hank said (“furthermore” is one
of his pet words, you know; he pronounces it
“futthermore”), “anybody who tries to start anything about
that little motherless and fatherless child being kep’
at home where she belongs, will find theirselves in a
contempt of court—or worse.”</p>

<p>He called Chris as a witness.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>Chris told the same story. He had heard the shot—so
on. All the same—his fright, the noises we were
making.</p>

<p>About then one of the Swedes got a bright idea. He
wanted to know if there weren’t any windows in our
house, and why none of us had tried to get out of our
room by way of the window.</p>

<p>Chris told him that the rooms across the front of
the house had windows out on to the sloping roof of
the downstairs porch, but that the windows across the
back of the house faced a sheer drop of close to thirty
feet.</p>

<p>Mr. Swede then decided that he had to have a plan
of the upstairs rooms drawn on the blackboard, right
then and there. Hank asked one of us to draw it. Who
volunteered? Who would? Aunt Gracia, of course. It
looked about like the sketch that I enclose.</p>

<figure>
  <img alt="A hand-drawn plan of the upper       floor of a house, consisting of eight bedrooms and one bathroom.       A hallway runs through the middle from front to back, with       stairs leading down on either end. There are also stairs leading       up to the attic in the back, behind a narrow door. The porch       roof runs along one side of the building, underneath the windows       of the four bedrooms on that side, belonging to Christoper,       Richard, Thaddeus, and Olympe.

  <figcaption>Gracia Quilter’s Sketch of the Second Floor</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Some fools tittered. I could have killed them. She had
no ruler, and the sketch was shaky, of course. But it
was plain enough, and gave the Swede exactly what he
had wanted. That is, it showed that Chris, or
Grandfather, or Olympe could have got out of a window and
gone along the porch roof to Father’s room.</p>

<p>Thopson asked Chris why he had not done just that.</p>

<p>Chris said: “I was out of my mind with fright. My wife
was missing from our room. Someone had been shot.
I could tell from the noises that others of the family
were also locked in their rooms. My one idea was to get
my door opened. Possibly, in another five minutes or
so, the idea of the window might have occurred to me.
I don’t know. I know that I did not, at the time, give
a thought to the window.”</p>

<p>Mr. Ward went to the blackboard and marked more
plainly the situation of the window with regard to the
roof—showing the distance, about five feet, of Chris’s
cupola window from the roof. He drew a slanted line,
to indicate a third pitch roof. He made a speech, trying
to convey the impression that any thought of the roof,
in connection with the case, was an absurdity. I don’t
know about the jury, but I do know that I remained
unconvinced.</p>

<p>You understand, Judy, I am not slurring at Chris, or
anything of the sort. But it is doggone queer that he
did not think of that window at all. What I really believe
about it is this: Physically, Chris has always been
something of a coward. Three months ago I’d have
denied moral cowardice for him; but his planning to sell
us out because Irene nagged him, makes me less
inclined to that denial. You remember the time Chris
didn’t pull Lucy out of the river when she had a cramp?
The time you jumped in with all your clothes on, and
did? And the time he fell out of the cherry tree into a
a hammock and fainted from fright, though he wasn’t
even bumped? It seems a lot more probable to me that
Chris did think of the window—that he looked out of it.
The fact that a man doesn’t drop out of a window on to
a slippery, slanted porch roof, at night, by no means
makes him a murderer. There are different sorts of
courage. Chris married Irene and brought her home
to Q 2.</p>

<p>I was afraid that Chris was in for a bad few minutes
concerning the window; but while Mr. Ward had been
talking, Pete Garret had, apparently, laboured. He
brought forth a mouse. He asked Chris why he had
locked Irene out of the room.</p>

<p>Chris said, “I did not lock my wife out of the room.”</p>

<p>Mr. Ward reminded the jury that the key to Chris’s
door had been found, along with the keys to the other
locked doors, on the table in Father’s room.</p>

<p>“The fiend,” said Mr. Ward, “having no idea that
this little lady was below stairs, had locked that door,
when he locked the other doors, in order to make sure
of the time required to effect his escape.”</p>

<p>I don’t know why Thopson had waited so long to take
up the subject of footprints. I imagine a good look at
the jury had decided him not to crowd them with ideas.
Though Mr. Ward had missed no opportunity to mention
escape, Thopson had stopped Irene’s story, and
mine, when we had come to the place about rushing into
Father’s room after Irene had unlocked the doors.</p>

<p>“Mr. Ward,” Thopson said to Chris, “keeps mentioning
the escape of the criminal. Will you tell the jury, Mr.
Quilter, exactly how you think this escape was made?”</p>

<p>Chris said, “I have no idea as to his method of
escape.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Ward has made repeated mention of a rope
hanging out of the open window of the victim’s room.
Will you please give us the exact situation of that rope?”</p>

<p>Chris told them what I have written to you.</p>

<p>“Do you agree with Mr. Ward that this rope was not
used as a means of escape?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I agree.”</p>

<p>“Will you tell us why?”</p>

<p>Chris told them.</p>

<p>“Now, Mr. Quilter, will you please tell the jury where
you did discover footprints that you had reason to
believe were made by the escaping criminal?”</p>

<p>Chris is a good looker, all right, Judy. I wasn’t
ashamed of him, sitting up there so clean and so alien
to that dirty hole, answering the questions in that low,
educated voice of his.</p>

<p>“There were no discoverable footprints,” he said,
“anywhere about our grounds.”</p>

<p>“Indeed? That makes your perplexity,
your—er—vagueness about his method of escape readily
understandable.”</p>

<p>“Nevertheless,” Chris inserted, “that he did find
some method of escape is evinced by the fact that he
has not been found in hiding in our home.”</p>

<p>“You all searched the place pretty well, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“We have searched repeatedly, and with absolute
thoroughness.”</p>

<p>One of the Swedes spoke up, in that slow, drawling,
damnable way they have, “Yoost a minute, Mr. Coroner.
Maaybe the fella is in the Quilter house yet, but
not hiding behind a door—aye?”</p>

<p>Hank said, “Say, get tired, can’t you? You guys
don’t seem to understand the offices of this here inquiry.
What we’re here for ain’t to put up a lot of tall talk.
Futthermore, it is to find out how the dirty son of a
sea cook got into the Quilter mansion and killed Dick
Quilter—one of the squarest men that ever lived—and
got away. We’ve got time, sure. But, at that, we ain’t
got all week, either, to set here and listen to you guys
beef about what ain’t got anything to do with the offices
of this inquiry. Futthermore, witness testified that there
weren’t no footprints they could find. Well, then, either
they overlooked the footprints, the which would be
easy enough on a place of that size, or else the guy hid in
the house somewheres. Futthermore, to sit here and
yappy-yap about him not hiding behind a door is
wasting everybody’s time. Nobody said he hid behind a
door, did they? Shut up! I’m talking, ain’t I? Present
witness excused. We’ll ask Mr. Quilter, Senior, to take
the stand, if he feels able. And we’ll try to listen to him
with the respect his years merit, to say nothing of his
attainments. Shut up! Am I coroner of Quilter County,
or ain’t I? Am I supposed to run these proceedings, or
had I better quit and turn them over to a rah-rah boy?
Thank you, Chris. You done fine. Now, then, Mr.
Quilter, if you’d as lief take the stand?”</p>

<p>I got that speech straight from Mattie’s notes. She
and I were talking together while we were waiting for
the verdict. She’s a good kid. I’ll admit that I was sort of
assuming the light and airy for her benefit—self-defence,
Judy, not orneriness; I can’t advertise my reserves—and
I said that speech of Hank’s was a classic, and that
I’d like to have it to preserve, word for word. She said,
“I’ll copy it from my notes for you,” and sat down and
got to work. An hour later, she came up with a bunch of
papers, torn from her notebook. “I thought you might
like to have Miss Quilter’s testimony, too,” she said.
“She was so wonderful,” and she handed me the papers
and skipped. It made me sort of think that somebody
must have told her about me pushing Lump Jones’s
face in for him, the night of the Youngs’ straw ride.
Gosh, but that seems twenty years removed from this
afternoon, and Grandfather’s having to take the
witness stand, and be questioned.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>Except for his manner of telling it, Grandfather’s
story was not very different from Chris’s or mine.</p>

<p>He had been wakened from his sleep by the sound of
a gunshot. (I think Grandfather called it a revolver
shot.) He had been mightily disturbed. He had lighted
his lamp, risen from his bed, and gone to the door. He
had found it locked—a circumstance that greatly
increased his anxiety. He had donned his dressing gown
and slippers. He had looked about him for a key, and he
had made various futile attempts to open his door
without it. He had gone to his window and opened it—had
perceived that snow had fallen. Caution, which his
increasing years had put upon him, had warned him
against the folly of attempting to retain his balance on
the sloping, snow-covered roof. He had turned again to
his room, in search of some heavy implement with which
to batter down his door. He had been unable to find
anything of the sort. The turmoil made by other members
of the family in their varied attempts to open their own
doors had materially abetted his own agitation. Several
times he had heard his daughter Gracia’s voice, calling
to him from behind her locked door, to ascertain the
state of his welfare. He had answered, but had seemed
unable to reassure her. Finally, after what had seemed
an interminable period of time, he had heard the
welcome sound of running feet in the hall. Shortly after
that, his niece, Mrs. Christopher Quilter, had unlocked
his door.</p>

<p>She had said to him his son’s name, “Dick!” and had
hastened up the hall.</p>

<p>He had gone at once to his son’s room. His nephew,
Christopher, and his son’s children, Lucy and Neal,
had been in the room when he had reached it. His son
was dead. “Gentlemen, I invite your questioning.”</p>

<p>Thopson came clear off his perch and asked Grandfather,
most respectfully, whether he knew of anyone
who would benefit by the death of Richard Quilter.</p>

<p>“Sir,” Grandfather answered, “my son’s death, far
from proving a benefit to any living person, has and will
prove a severe loss to many. I am speaking now merely
of material loss. My son was the manager of Q 2 Ranch.
On his ability and acumen the fortune of our entire
family largely depended.”</p>

<p>“I had heard,” Thopson said, “that there had been
some talk of selling the Q 2 Ranch.”</p>

<p>“My nephew, Christopher, had been approached
with offers of purchase. Up to the present time, he has
accepted none of them. However, is that not beside the
point? Had the present Quilter properties been sold,
others would have been immediately purchased as an
estate for the family. My son’s services would have been
more necessary, if possible, on the new ranch than they
have been on the old.”</p>

<p>Roy Ulander spoke up from the jury. For a minute,
when he began to speak, I was crazy mad, remembering
all Grandfather had done for him, and thinking that
Roy was going to quiz him. I was mistaken. Roy took
that minute to attempt to console Grandfather. He said
that he knew Neal and Phineas and he—Grandfather—would
be able to carry the ranch along all right. He
added, not wholly to my delight, that I was a good,
steady lad and a fine worker, with an old head on young
shoulders.</p>

<p>Grandfather thanked him.</p>

<p>Thopson wanted to know whether Father had left a
will.</p>

<p>Grandfather said that he had not.</p>

<p>Thopson commented, “Very strange.”</p>

<p>Grandfather begged leave to differ with him. He
explained that, aside from Father’s modest personal
effects, Father had nothing to will to anyone.</p>

<p>“No life insurance?”</p>

<p>“None, sir,” Grandfather said.</p>

<p>“I see.” But Thopson managed to put into those two
words a commentary, caustic, on the character of a
man who ventures to die without life insurance.</p>

<p>Grandfather rebutted with the information that,
until 1893, both he and Father had carried large
policies. Since that time, Grandfather said, they had
been unable to keep up the premiums.</p>

<p>Thopson grew faintly argumentative. He stated that
the better companies carried their policy holders for
several years.</p>

<p>“As did our company, sir, for six years,” Grandfather
replied.</p>

<p>Thopson observed that it was difficult for him to
understand why a family, who had ample means for all
the luxuries of life, including education in Eastern
universities, foreign travel, and what-not, could not afford
the necessity of keeping up small life-insurance
premiums.</p>

<p>“The premiums,” Grandfather informed him,
“amounted to well over fifteen hundred dollars a year.
However, my understanding is, that the purpose of this
inquiry was to discover, if possible, where, when, and
by what means Richard Quilter came to his death.
That its purpose was not to inquire into the details of
our domestic financial managements and expenditures.”</p>

<p>“Precisely, Mr. Quilter,” Thopson accepted.
“Precisely. Our purpose is to discover, as you have said,
where, when, and by what means Richard Quilter came
to his death. Now, Mr. Quilter, I think I may say,
without fear of contradiction, that you more than anyone
else in this room are desirous of discovering, also,
the person who is responsible for the death of your son.
May I, then, offer you the results of my experience?”
(Hot lot of experience that guy has had. He is still
downy.)</p>

<p>His question, of course, was rhetorical. But Grandfather
answered it, when Thopson stopped to breathe.</p>

<p>“You may, sir.”</p>

<p>“In cases of this sort, the logical approach is to find,
if possible, the reason for the crime. That is to say,
before we can discover who committed the crime it is
necessary to discover why the crime was committed.
Now, if your son had left money to some person, there
we would have what we professional men call a motive
for the murder.”</p>

<p>“You have made yourself clear,” Grandfather said.
“However, unfortunately, perhaps, for you professional
men, my son left not one cent on earth.”</p>

<p>“You are positive of that?”</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>“You aren’t?”</p>

<p>“No, sir. I am confident of it. I am positive of
nothing.”</p>

<p>“Then,” Thopson produced, “perhaps it won’t surprise
you greatly when I tell you that Richard Quilter
did leave a neat little sum of money.”</p>

<p>For one flickering instant Grandfather exposed his
complete stupefaction to the rabble. Then, as he often
does, he built a blind of his Johnson and got behind it.</p>

<p>“You do not surprise me, sir. You do astonish me.
Proceed, if you please, to enlighten me.”</p>

<p>Up to this time, as I have said, Thopson had been as
decent as a mucker of his sort could be toward
Grandfather. But now that he was to enlighten, he assumed
an oily, confidential, between-you-and-me manner that
made me have to hang on to my chair to keep from lifting
myself out of it and giving him a swift kick. Chris,
who was sitting between Irene and me, saw that I was
getting hot, I think, because right then he caught hold
of my arm with a firm grip.</p>

<p>In this new manner of his, Thopson informed Grandfather,
and all of us, that, by the merest chance, he had
discovered that Father had carried an accident policy
for the past eight years. A friend of Thopson’s was an
underwriter for the firm that Father had been insured
with. This agent—that’s a good enough word for
me—had told Thopson that, if Richard Quilter’s death
proved to be accidental, their company would have to
pay the heirs ten thousand dollars.</p>

<p>“Sir,” Grandfather said, “I can but wish that your
informant had been himself correctly informed. My son
did carry such a policy. Unfortunately, it was allowed
to lapse only last year.”</p>

<p>Thopson forgot himself. “Not on your life it wasn’t.
The premium was only forty dollars a year. If Richard
Quilter himself didn’t keep up the payments, then
somebody else has kept them up. Undoubtedly, some
member of the family. Now, if we can find who made
the last payment——”</p>

<p>Dr. Joe stood up. “I made that last payment,” he
said, and sat down.</p>

<p>Thopson chose to get suddenly solemn. “Mr. Quilter,
were you aware of the fact that Dr. Elm had made this
payment?”</p>

<p>Hank said, “Don’t answer him, Mr. Quilter. You’ve
told him once. If he’s deaf, we can’t fiddle-faddle around
with him all week. Futthermore, he’s a waste of time.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Thopson,” Grandfather said, “I was not aware
of the fact that anyone had made the payment. My
belief was that the policy had been allowed to lapse.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Quilter, can you give any reasonable explanation
of the fact that your son had not told you of Dr.
Elm’s having paid this premium?”</p>

<p>“I trust, sir,” Grandfather replied, “that I should not
attempt an unreasonable explanation. I give you what
seems to me a most reasonable one when I state that I
fancy my son was not cognizant of the fact that his
friend, Dr. Elm, had met this obligation for him.”</p>

<p>And again Thopson forgot himself. “You mean he
didn’t know it? You bet he knew it. Last August he
went to the company’s office, in Portland, and tried to
collect damages for a sprained wrist, or something.”</p>

<p>Dr. Joe stood up, emphatically.</p>

<p>Thopson said, “One moment, Dr. Elm.”</p>

<p>Hank said, “Go on ahead, Doc, if you’ve got
something to say.”</p>

<p>Dr. Joe said, “Oh—plenty of time.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Quilter,” Thopson had retrieved himself,
solemnity and all, “would ten thousand dollars make
any particular difference to anyone on the Q 2 Ranch
at the present time?”</p>

<p>“The answer to the question, which I infer you are
trying to put, is: Yes, sir, it would.”</p>

<p>“To whom?”</p>

<p>“To all of us.”</p>

<p>“Then,” Thopson shot out, “if this ten thousand
dollars is collectible, every person on the Q 2 Ranch at
present would benefit because of it?”</p>

<p>“That is true,” Grandfather said.</p>

<p>Thopson said he had finished with the witness. Mr.
Ward stood.</p>

<p>“Mr. Quilter,” he asked, “in all matters you were
your son’s confidant, were you not?”</p>

<p>“So I believed,” Grandfather answered.</p>

<p>“Since he had not told you that this policy was still
operative, is it probable that he had told any other
member of the family?”</p>

<p>“It would seem not. However, I cannot be certain.
My son had never attached importance to that policy.
He believed that the company was an unreliable one.
My son’s failure to tell me of Dr. Elm’s kindness might
have been because he knew of my dislike for monetary
dealings with our friends. It might have been that so
trivial an episode passed out of his mind. Or, it might
have been that Dr. Elm himself asked Richard not to
mention his act of kindness. In any of these events, it
would seem unlikely that Richard had mentioned the
affair to any other member of the family. I have
expressed myself poorly. My meaning is, that the same
considerations which would have kept Richard from
telling me of this would have kept him, also, from telling
anyone else.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Mr. Quilter. One more question, if you
will be so good. You have told Mr. Thopson that your
family would benefit from the payment of the ten
thousand dollars’ indemnity. There are few families, I
should think by the way, to whom ten thousand dollars
would be of no benefit whatever. The same question,
put to any member of the jury, would, I am certain,
be answered as you have answered it. My point is this:
Would the money, for any reason, be more acceptable
to you now than it would have been at any time in
the past ten years? Or, to put it still more clearly: One
year ago your son’s life was insured for a large
amount—twenty, thirty thousand dollars. Would not thirty
thousand dollars have been more useful to Q 2 Ranch
than ten thousand dollars?”</p>

<p>You see what he did, Judy? He asked the first question,
and then he would not allow Grandfather to answer
it. He kept right on going. And the question which
Grandfather finally had to answer was: Which is the
larger amount, ten or thirty thousand dollars?</p>

<p>Do you know why Mr. Ward did that? I know. It was
because he believes that one of us Quilters is guilty. It
is because he was afraid of Grandfather’s honesty.</p>

<p>I thought that Grandfather might scorn the loophole.
He did not. He answered, “Sir, thirty thousand dollars
would surely have been more useful to the Q 2 Ranch
than a problematical ten thousand dollars. I may add,
that my son’s life insurance was with an old, reliable
company. Have I correctly answered your question?”</p>

<p>“You have; and thank you, Mr. Quilter.”</p>

<p>I told you why Mr. Ward had asked the question as
he had. I think I don’t need to tell you why Grandfather
answered it as he did. Or, perhaps I should say, I
have told you before this why Grandfather answered
it as he did.</p>

<p>Grandfather came back to his seat beside Aunt
Gracia. Dr. Joe was called to the stand.</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>Thopson elected sternness. “Dr. Elm, where were you
on the night of Monday, October eighth?”</p>

<p>“I was attending Mrs. H. F. Ferndell, in Portland,
Oregon. She gave birth to an infant daughter at one
o’clock in the morning.”</p>

<p>“You can, of course, produce witnesses to
substantiate this alibi?”</p>

<p>“Not an alibi,” Dr. Joe said, with perfect gravity.
“A birth.”</p>

<p>“You can prove that you were where you claim at
have been on the night of Richard Quilter’s death. And
allow me to remind you, Dr. Elm, that this is no place
to indulge in forced witticisms.”</p>

<p>Dr. Joe said, “How does it go? ‘ “There’s nae ill in a
merry wind,” quo’ the wife when she whistled through
the kirk.’ Well, get on. Get on!”</p>

<p>“I have asked you whether you could prove that
you were where you claim to have been in Portland, on
the night of October eighth.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. There were two grandmothers, three
or four uncles and aunts, the father, the patient, and,
of course, the infant. The whole thing hinges on whether
or not those people could be got to confess that they had
me for their physician. I should say it was doubtful.
Oh, get on, you—you. Of course I can prove it.”</p>

<p>“Very well. Will you, then, tell this jury how it
happened that a man in your circumstances should have
undertaken to keep up an insurance policy for another
man?”</p>

<p>Dr. Joe said, “I paid my board bill last month. Did
you?”</p>

<p>Thopson turned to Hank. “Mr. Coroner, I
appeal——”</p>

<p>Hank said, “He asked you a civil question. Can’t you
answer it?”</p>

<p>One of the Swedes found voice. “Maaybe, I tank the
doctor he don’t want to tell about paying oop the
insurance.”</p>

<p>Dr. Joe said, “Sure, I’d just as lief tell. I was out at
Dick’s house, early last year, when the bill came for his
premium on this policy. Dick said that he thought he
would drop it—that it was a shyster company. And it
was—there’s something else I can prove,
Mr.—What’s-your-name—though I didn’t know it at the time. I
had a policy of my own with the same company. I told
Dick I thought it was foolish to drop a thing like that,
for forty a year. He said forty was too much to waste,
and that he had spent his last available cent for the
month, anyway. I asked him to let me pay it this
year—said he could count it against what I owed him.”</p>

<p>“You were in debt to the deceased?”</p>

<p>“Yes. To him and his family.”</p>

<p>“What was the amount of this debt?”</p>

<p>Dr. Joe said, “I was afraid I might be asked that, so
I reckoned it up in cold figures here lately. It came to
a million and four dollars and twenty cents. Or, though
likely you won’t understand, I am in debt to these
people for friendship, for a place that feels like home,
for——”</p>

<p>“It is not a question, however, of actual monetary
debt?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t suppose you’d think so. Well, anyhow,
I asked him to let me send the check in for him this year,
or until he was in cash again.</p>

<p>“He refused, point-blank. And there, as he thought,
the matter ended. When I left the ranch, I swiped the
bill; and, later in the month, I sent in a check with a
letter telling the company to be sure to send the receipt
to me. Warning them, under no circumstances, to send
it to Q 2. Consequently, they mailed Dick the
receipted bill in the next mail.</p>

<p>“In the meantime, he had told Mr. Quilter here that
he had decided to allow the policy to lapse. Mr. Quilter
agreed with him that it was as well to have done so.
Time will probably prove that he was right about it.
He usually is.</p>

<p>“When Dick got the receipted bill, he knew what I
had done. I can’t say that he was particularly grateful
to me. He insisted that I take his note—all that sort of
stuff. He said that he wouldn’t say anything to his
father about it, because his father hated being under
obligations to friends. I told him he had better not tell
his father. Threat—you see. I guess that ends the story.”</p>

<p>Dr. Joe started to walk away. Thopson winged him
with: “One minute, please. Did the deceased tell any
other member of his family about this somewhat
unusual proceeding?”</p>

<p>“They are here,” Dr. Joe said. “Do you want me to
ask them?”</p>

<p>Hank said, “This ain’t a trial. I’ll ask them. Save
time. Miss Quilter—never mind leaving your seat for a
little informal matter like this—did you know Dick
had this fake accident policy?”</p>

<p>Aunt Gracia said that she had known of it, several
years ago. But that Father had told her, when he had
told Grandfather, that he had decided to let it lapse.</p>

<p>“What about you, Neal?” Hank asked.</p>

<p>I told him I had known nothing about it. I had known
that Father was all cut up about having to let the life
insurance go; and I had supposed that it left him
entirely uninsured.</p>

<p>Hank began to ask Chris, next; but Thopson got
funny and said that he insisted on having these answers
under oath. I didn’t think Hank would allow him to
get away with it, but he did. I suppose he had to.</p>

<p>Thopson took Irene first. He asked her whether she
had known about the policy. She said that she had not.
The witness was excused.</p>

<p>Chris was called, and sworn in. “Yes,” he said, “I
knew that Dick was carrying some sort of an accident
policy. When we were in Portland together, last August,
my Uncle Phineas and I went with Dick to put in his
claim for payment because of his injured wrist.”</p>

<p>“How did all three of you happen to go? Did he think
he’d need to be backed up?”</p>

<p>“Not at all. We had been lunching together. After
luncheon, Dick said he was going to stop at the
company’s office. We stopped with him.” Chris then went
on to say that they had been treated to various insults,
had been asked to produce witnesses to the accident,
among other extraordinary demands, and had finally
been curtly dismissed with instructions to call again.
Chris said that he and Uncle Phineas were both angry.
But that Father had merely said it served him right for
attempting to deal with crooks, and that he would never
go to their office again, nor pay another premium. In so
far as he was concerned, Chris said, he had not given
the matter of the policy another thought. He had not
known that it had carried any such indemnity in case of
accidental death. He had known nothing more
concerning it.</p>

<p>“Did you,” Thopson questioned, “happen to mention
this matter to your wife?”</p>

<p>“You have heard my wife’s testimony. I did not.”</p>

<p>“Not in the habit of confiding in your wife, eh?”</p>

<p>Chris kept his temper like a gentleman. It was more
than I could have done, but I was proud of him for doing
it. “I am not in the habit of burdening my wife with
exhaustively trivial details which could neither amuse
nor interest her.”</p>

<p>“Did your uncle, Phineas Quilter, feel the same way
about confiding in his wife?”</p>

<p>“I should assume that he did. However, I am unable
to answer for the feelings of my uncle.”</p>

<p>“You don’t know, then, whether the lady who is at
home sick in bed was aware of the ten-thousand-dollar
indemnity?”</p>

<p>“I think not. My aunt is not a secretive person. Had
she known, I fancy she would have told some one of us,
at least. Also, my Uncle Phineas had not known of the
policy prior to the day when we called at the office of
the company with my Cousin Dick. Since that time, my
Uncle Phineas has not returned to Q 2 Ranch.”</p>

<p>“Your uncle, I suppose, never writes any letters to
his wife?”</p>

<p>“He writes to her, certainly.”</p>

<p>“And if he had written to her about the policy, you
think she would not agree with you that the
ten-thousand-dollar indemnity was too trivial to mention?”</p>

<p>“I have told you, under oath, that I had not known
of that indemnity.”</p>

<p>“It makes quite a difference as to the policy’s
importance, doesn’t it?”</p>

<p>“It does.”</p>

<p>“By the way, Mr. Quilter, have you tried, recently,
to put another mortgage on Q 2 Ranch?”</p>

<p>“I have.”</p>

<p>“Were you attending to that when you were in
Portland, last August?”</p>

<p>“I was.”</p>

<p>“Did you succeed in raising the money you wanted?”</p>

<p>“I did not.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Quilter, how long have you and your wife been
residing on Q 2 Ranch?”</p>

<p>“We came there last March.”</p>

<p>Thopson counted on his stubby fingers. “Seven
months. You were not at the Q 2 Ranch at any time
last year, were you?”</p>

<p>“We were not.”</p>

<p>“Finished with the witness.”</p>

<p>I hoped that Mr. Ward would take Chris, then. He
did not. He sat still.</p>

<p>They called Aunt Gracia to the stand.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>I had been as nervous as an old woman about Aunt
Gracia all during these everlasting proceedings. She
and I had ridden to Quilterville together to keep from
crowding the carriage.</p>

<p>We were no sooner mounted, and off, than she began
to talk to me about hoping I’d be “discreet” at the
inquest. I did not understand her, at first. We had held
sort of a family council before we had left home and
Grandfather had talked to us. Over and over—you know
how unusual it is for Grandfather to be reiterative—he
had impressed upon us the necessity for telling the
absolute truth.</p>

<p>He explained, of course, that he did not suppose any
of us would lie, but that affairs of this sort were apt to
invite attempted diplomacy, finesse. None of us,
Grandfather went on to say, had any reason to fear the
truth. Truth, he asked us to remember, was the one
thing that could not ultimately be defeated. He gave us
rather a sermon, insisting that truth bred truth as surely
as cabbages bred cabbages, or as lies bred lies.
Grandfather, as you know, would neither dictate nor appeal;
but he came closer to each, in this talk to us, than I had
ever heard him come.</p>

<p>I was still thinking of his last statement (Lucy would
call it a pearl), “One cannot bargain with truth,” when
Aunt Gracia began her talk about discretion. It seemed
to me that she was unsaying most of the things Grandfather
had said; but it was easier to doubt my own
understanding than it was to doubt either Aunt Gracia’s
dutifulness or her rigid integrity. It wasn’t long, though,
until she gave me no opportunity for choice; so then I
asked her, straight, if she was disagreeing with what
Grandfather had said to us in the parlour.</p>

<p>She answered that Grandfather was old, very old,
and at present frightfully weakened from shock, grief,
and the impending horror of disgrace. She said that,
fundamentally, what Grandfather had been telling us
about truth was sound; but, in many circumstances,
truth should become a delicate thing, to be handled
delicately, not swung as a bludgeon. She said that truth
might breed truth, if it were planted in the proper soil.
If it were tossed carelessly to the four winds it might
breed nothing—as cabbage seeds sown in the sagebrush
would breed nothing—or it might breed anything:
destruction, disgrace. Grandfather’s idealism, she
remarked, like many other beautiful things, was not
always the most practical asset in a time of emergency.</p>

<p>You will understand, Judy, that I actually had to turn
in my saddle and look to make sure that it was Aunt
Gracia, of the nonadjustable moralities, who was riding
beside me.</p>

<p>She misread my look, because she said: “Exactly,
Neal. We are to use the truth to-day, but we are to use
it carefully, with discretion. For instance, dear, the
fact that I can find comfort in the knowledge that Dick
died in a state of perfect grace, need not be brought out.
Unless we are directly questioned, I should think the
entire circumstance of Dick’s recent baptism might
better be omitted from the testimony. Too, I can see
no reason for telling anyone who may be there to-day
about the fact that Dick and Christopher had recently
exchanged rooms.”</p>

<p>“Aunt Gracia,” I asked, “do you think that some
one of us meant to kill Chris, and blundered into
Father’s room, by mistake?”</p>

<p>She evaded that by saying it was more important,
now, to plan for the future than it was to probe into
the past.</p>

<p>I told her that I agreed with her. But, I fancy, we did
not mean the same thing. It was a peach of a morning,
Judy. The snow had melted. The air was sweet. Hiroshige
had done the sky, and our brown old hills lay softly
in front of it. It was not the realization of death, it was
the realization of life—of a world alive; even our hills
were only napping—that made me go suddenly rabid.</p>

<p>Aunt Gracia interrupted my ravings. “Don’t, Neal.
Don’t,” she commanded. “You sound like Jasper in
<i>Edwin Drood</i>.”</p>

<p>That was plain enough, wasn’t it? “Aunt Gracia,” I
said, “it is bothering you, isn’t it, to decide whether
I shot Father because I thought that he was going
insane, or whether I meant to go into Chris’s room that
night, and shot Father by mistake?”</p>

<p>“Why do you say that?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Because you say we must mention neither the baptism
nor the changed rooms at the inquest to-day. Because
I know that you have suspected me, from the first.
Would it help you any to have me swear to you, out
here in the open, that I am as innocent as you are?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said.</p>

<p>“I swear it, Aunt Gracia.”</p>

<p>We rode along and had made the ford before she
said another word. She came up beside me on the east
river path.</p>

<p>“Neal,” she said, “this is an irreligious community.
Consequently, there are two words they like to roll
around their tongues—‘Religious fanatic.’ I am hoping
they won’t think of those two words to-day.”</p>

<p>She grew intense. She does, you know, once in a blue
moon. She said that she wasn’t a coward. She said she
would be glad to say that she had killed Father, and
then go to join him, and Mother, and the others in one
of the highest states of glory. But, she said, such a false
confession could do nothing but bring added shame and
grief to the family. If only, she said, she were not a
Quilter—then how eagerly she would sacrifice her own
life and honour for the honour of the Quilters.</p>

<p>I felt, of course, like asking her not to be an idiot. I
didn’t. I produced some banality about the uselessness
of such a sacrifice—allowing the real criminal to go free,
all that.</p>

<p>“I know,” she answered, “but—the ecstasy of it!
The exquisite, vivid ecstasy of such a sacrifice. Or—of
any sacrifice. Isn’t it odd, Neal, that no one ever pities
Isaac?”</p>

<p>You can understand, Judy, that that just about
knocked me a twister. You can understand, too, why I
had been dreading Aunt Gracia’s turn as a witness. I
tell you what, Jude, every one of the family has got the
rotten habit of thinking that, because Aunt Gracia’s
mind is different from our own, it is inferior—deformed.
We have no right to the comparison. It is as unfair as
comparing—well, say ice and water. I’d be bound to
muddle a metaphor here—but Aunt Gracia’s mind is
surely more fluid in its mysticism than are ours in their
set materialism. This is all pretty poor. I wish you might
have been there, to-day, to see and hear Aunt Gracia.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>When I saw her gather up the skirt of her long black
riding habit and walk across that dirty room and take
her place in the witness chair, the thought flashed
through my mind that it was a wonder that Olympe, ill
or not, would have forgone such an opportunity. Only,
and I’m not meaning to knock Olympe, either, Aunt
Gracia’s dignity and distinction were natural,
untrimmed: the difference between one of our Percherons
in a meadow or decked out in a circus parade.</p>

<p>Hank put her through the usual preliminaries, and
then asked her, as he had asked us, to tell the jury what
she knew about the murder.</p>

<p>Sitting there, dressed in black in that gloomy room,
with her face a white oval and her long hands, white
and still in her lap, she needed a Rembrandt. She is old,
past thirty, but she is beautiful; especially beautiful
with her head tipped as she had it this afternoon, so
that her thin features are a bit foreshortened. And as for
her voice—they can extol soft, velvety, throaty voices
for women. But I’ll take Aunt Gracia’s voice every
time—it is like a clear glass bell being rung with
decorum.</p>

<p>“My story,” she said, “would be precisely the same
as the stories the others have told you. My fright, my
efforts to open my door, my release, could further in
no way the purposes of this inquiry. You have listened,
patiently, to three accounts of the sort; but you are, I
believe, no nearer the truth than you were in the beginning.
It seems wise to me, now, to bring several matters
to your attention.</p>

<p>“You have not taken into account the fact that
whoever was in my brother’s room on Monday night must
have been there for sometime before the shot was fired.
The rope was not put in place after the shot was fired.
From the position of the rope in the snow, and from
the amount of snow that had fallen on it, we were able
to tell that the rope must have been lying, for at least
an hour, exactly where we found it.</p>

<p>“My brother was a light sleeper. Does it seem reasonable,
even possible, that anyone could come into his
room, open a window, tie a rope around his bedstead,
toss the rope out of the window, while he slept? Or,
while he lay there in bed and calmly watched the person
making these preparations? If, for some reason, my
brother had been unable to move—though he was not
unable to move—don’t you know that he would have
called, cried out for help? You have listened to the
testimony that members of the family could be plainly
heard shouting to one another through the closed
locked doors. Would my brother, would any man, lie in
silence, motionless, and allow some intruder to remain
in his room?</p>

<p>“No; not unless he were forced to do so. What could
have forced him? The gun that killed him—nothing else.
But not the gun alone. The gun in the hands of some
strong, powerful person of whom my brother would
have been afraid.</p>

<p>“I wonder how many people in this county would
testify that Richard Quilter was a brave man? Every
person, I think, who knew him. I wonder how many
people would have dared to sneak into my brother’s
room and menace him with a gun. Very few, I believe.</p>

<p>“It has been suggested, or, perhaps, I should say
insinuated, that my cousin, Irene Quilter, shot my
brother. Look at her. Do you think she would have
dared? Assume that she did dare. Do you think that
she could have frightened my brother—a man six feet
tall and afraid of nothing? How long do you think it
would have taken him to leap from his bed and seize
any weapon held in her trembling hands? She is a frail
woman, bred in an Eastern city. Probably she has never
discharged a gun in her life. She, as you must know,
could not menace a coward for five minutes. Could she
have menaced Richard Quilter for an hour—two hours?</p>

<p>“It took a man who was expert with a gun to be able
to keep my brother covered while he stooped to tie
that rope around the foot of the bed. True, he had it in
readiness, or so it would surely seem. He had one loop
made, shall we say? But, gentlemen, to draw fifty feet
of rope through a loop is not the work of an instant.
The murderer had to stoop to fasten the rope. He had
to do it with his left hand, while his right hand held the
gun that cowed my brother.</p>

<p>“Dr. Elm has told me, and will testify under oath,
that my brother was not drugged at the time of his
death; that he had been given no drug of any sort before
his death. Can you see Dick Quilter, as you knew him,
alert, active, fearless, lying there in bed while some
weak, inadequate person crouched to place that rope? I
think you cannot.</p>

<p>“Three women were in the house that night: an old
lady, past sixty—my aunt, Olympe Quilter—Irene
Quilter, and I. Also, there was my little niece, Richard’s
daughter, a twelve-year-old child. Do you think that
Richard would have allowed any one of us to threaten
him with a gun for a longer time than it took him to
reach us and take the thing away from us?</p>

<p>“My father was in the house that night. You know
him. But, aside from that, you have seen him on the
witness stand to-day. He is eighty years old. Would
Richard have been afraid to unarm him, do you fancy?
Would Richard have been afraid to unarm this eighteen-year-old
son of his? Or, could Richard have been afraid
of our cousin, Christopher Quilter?</p>

<p>“I dislike saying this, here, but I will say it because I
must. My brother loved our Cousin Christopher; but he
scorned him. He thought, perhaps rightly, that
Christopher was a weakling. Though Richard had been ill for
some time, he could work all day at tasks that tired
Christopher in a few hours. What opportunity in an
Eastern university, in his studies abroad, had
Christopher had to develop prowess with a gun? He was
never a sportsman. As a boy he never went hunting.
I doubt that he has fired a gun half a dozen times in
his life. All of which would mean nothing, perhaps, but
for the fact that Richard knew it as well as I know it.
Do you think that Christopher, a man of much frailer
physique than my brother, could have frightened him
for five minutes; could have kept him cowed and silent
for an hour? Do you think that Dick Quilter, with any
one of these seven people, would not have made an
attempt to save himself?”</p>

<p>Thopson interrupted and wanted to know if Aunt
Gracia was not overlooking the fact that, perhaps,
Richard Quilter was in the act of making that attempt
when he was shot.</p>

<p>“I will remind you,” Aunt Gracia said, “that the
rope had been in the position we found it for at least an
hour. Nothing but knowledge that such an attempt
would mean certain death could have held my brother
passive for an hour. As you suggest, it is possible that
at last, in desperation, he did make an attempt to save
himself. You know the result.</p>

<p>“There is another point that has not been touched
upon: the lighted lamp in Richard’s room that night. I
had put the small bedside lamp, newly filled, as usual,
in his room that evening. At midnight, the lamp was
burning low; the oil was all but exhausted. Since, I have
refilled the lamp and tested it for time. It took two hours
and a half to consume as much oil as had been consumed
on Monday night. It had never been my brother’s
practice to read in bed. There was no book or magazine
near his bed. Why should the lamp have burned
throughout the night?</p>

<p>“Assume that when Richard went into his room
that night, the murderer was hiding there—probably
in the clothes closet—and, after Richard had got into
bed, but before he had reached to extinguish the light,
the man had stepped out, with the gun levelled on
him——”</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t you say, Miss Quilter, that two hours
and a half was a long time for the murderer to have
spent in your brother’s room?”</p>

<p>“I should, indeed.”</p>

<p>“A long time, too, for such a man as your brother to
have allowed himself to be ‘menaced’ without making
an attempt to disarm the fellow, without raising his
voice in outcry?”</p>

<p>“It seems to me that is precisely what I have been
contending, Mr. Thopson. I presume, however, that
you have thought ahead to the second point which I
was about to make. This:</p>

<p>“We have no way of knowing what went on in Dick’s
room that night. None of us, I am sure, knows all
there is to be known about any other person. We think
that there was no hidden chapter, no hidden page or
paragraph in my brother’s life. We cannot know it.
Suppose some ruffian was making a blackmailing demand
from Richard. Suppose that Richard was as eager
as was the man himself to keep the rest of us from
knowing that he—the murderer, I mean—was in the
house; had any reason for being there.</p>

<p>“We know nothing of these possibilities now. I hope
we may know, in time. What we do know now is that
no member of this family could have caused Richard one
moment’s alarm. That he could have and would have
disarmed any one of us in the snatch of a second, and
sent us ashamed away from him.</p>

<p>“My brother’s corpse is lying in the adjoining room. I
ask the jury to look at it. To see the size of the man,
the breadth of his shoulders. I ask them to see what can
be seen in his dead face—the strength, the purpose, the
courage. I ask them to return and look at us, here. Then
they will know, since they are just, wise men, that I
have spoken the truth.”</p>

<p>Impressive? Golly, Jude, it was a knockout. On the
square, it is thanks to Aunt Gracia—the family disgrace
because she happens to be a mystic—that Irene, or
Chris, or, probably, both of them aren’t going to have
to appear before the Grand Jury. And, if you will forgive
the old wise crack, it wasn’t so much what she said
as the way she said it. Sitting there, so aloof and so
lovely, speaking in that clear, unafraid voice of hers, she
conveyed the impression that no man’s doubt could
damage her; that any man’s doubt would prove him a
fool or a monster. One doesn’t, you know, look at the
white moon in a black night’s sky and remark, “I don’t
believe it.” And yet, after all, the moon is not a large
and luminous dinner plate.</p>

<p>Note, Judy: Aunt Gracia had made a special point,
to me in private, of the fact that Father was taking
medicine that made him sleep heavily. Dr. Joe knew
it. Would he have called a sleeping medicine “drugs”?
Possibly, almost certainly, not if he had had a talk with
Aunt Gracia before the inquest. Because, you see, if
Father had been drugged into a heavy sleep, all Aunt
Gracia’s arguments would amount to nothing. The
person could have crept into the room, made the
arrangements with the rope without waking Father; could
have fired the shot, and could have got away. Smash
goes the fact of Father’s lack of fear; smash goes the
fact of his disarming any one of us; smash goes the
expert gunman—smash for all of it. Not much bravery
is required to shoot a sleeping man.</p>

<p>It doesn’t seem reasonable to suppose that, even if
Father had been drugged and asleep, some guy would
have had the nerve to stick around in the room for a
couple of hours with the lamp burning. But it is possible,
anyway, that Father got into bed and was so dopey, and
tired that he dropped off to sleep and forgot to blow out
the light.</p>

<p>Here is another thing, Judy. If the guy had been hiding
in Father’s room before Father came into it, couldn’t
he have fixed the rope then? Sure he could. Father
didn’t look under his bed at night, did he? He would
have noticed if the window had been open and the rope
stretched across to it as we found it. But he wouldn’t
have noticed a loop of rope around the leg of his bed.
The fellow did not, necessarily, have to pull the fifty
feet of rope through the loop with one hand while he
used the other hand to keep Father covered with a gun.</p>

<p>Since I didn’t think through to any of this until I was
riding home from Quilterville this evening, I am fairly
certain that the jury hasn’t come to it yet. For one
thing, as I have said, Aunt Gracia obviated doubt by
making it seem idiotic and indecent. For another thing,
the jury, at the last, was straining every nerve to live up
to her description and look like wise and just men.</p>

<p>When Aunt Gracia had finished her speech, which
I’ve copied straight from Mattie’s notes for you, she
began to gather her skirts into one hand, preparatory to
leaving the witness chair.</p>

<p>Chris whispered to me, “Bless her, she’s turned the
tide!”</p>

<p>Thopson said, “One moment, please, Miss Quilter.”</p>

<p>Aunt Gracia sat back in her chair, and dropped her
hands, quiet as dead things, into her lap again.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>Thopson started off with a lot of con talk about how
helpful she had been, and about how she had his
gratitude and the gratitude of the jury for her plain
speaking. It was only through such methods as hers,
extolled he, that the guilty wretch could ever be brought
to justice. It sounded great. But I felt, like the
carpenter, that the butter was spread too thick. Aunt
Gracia sat, pale and placid, and looking about as
susceptible to flattery as my but recently mentioned
moon.</p>

<p>“You have implied,” Thopson finally came to it,
“that your brother might have had an enemy. By a
rigorous searching of your memory, would it be possible
for you to recall who this enemy might be?”</p>

<p>“But, of course,” Aunt Gracia answered, “I thought
that you knew. Seventeen, nearly eighteen years ago,
my brother killed a man as he would have killed a mad
dog, or a rattlesnake, or any dangerous thing that was
attacking his wife. He was tried, and acquitted. The
jury did not leave the room. The judge apologized to
Richard—or so I have been told—explaining that the
trial had been merely a conformance to the letter of the
law.”</p>

<p>“Do you know the name of the man whom Richard
Quilter killed?”</p>

<p>“Enos Karabass. The Pennsylvania Dutch, I believe,
are unfortunate people to anger.”</p>

<p>“His family lives in this vicinity?”</p>

<p>“No, they do not.”</p>

<p>“Were they informed concerning the manner of his
death?”</p>

<p>“We were unable to find that he had any people.”</p>

<p>Thopson gave himself over to pity. “But, my dear
Miss Quilter——”</p>

<p>“You asked me if it could be possible that my brother
had an enemy. Any man who has ever killed another
man might, it seems to me, have dangerous enemies from
that time forth.”</p>

<p>“I see. I see. Granted, then, for the sake of argument
that that man had a brother, or a son, who wanted to
avenge his death. Would it have been possible for him
to enter your home without detection?”</p>

<p>“Quite possible. Our outside doors are never locked
until the last thing at night. While we were at supper, in
the dining room, anyone could have walked in, quietly,
and gone upstairs.”</p>

<p>“You have no watchdogs on your place?”</p>

<p>“We have two dogs. I mentioned suppertime because,
usually at that hour, the dogs are at the back of the
house waiting for, or eating, their suppers.”</p>

<p>“Very well. He could have gotten into the house. He
could have hidden in your brother’s bedroom. But—— Could
he have gotten out of the house? That is, could
he have gotten out of the house without leaving any
footprints in the snow? This does seem to bring us back
to the beginning, doesn’t it?”</p>

<p>Aunt Gracia said, “He could have got out of the
house, because he did get out. How he escaped we have
not, as yet, been able to discover. That is the problem
to be solved. We have one fact. He is not in our home
at present. That leads to another fact, unexplained,
but not conjectural. He has escaped. It is stupid, and
so it is an insult to the intelligence of this jury for us to
keep insisting that the man could not have got out of the
house, when we all know that he <em>has</em> got out of the
house.”</p>

<p>The jury shone from the sensation of having their
intelligences mentioned.</p>

<p>“Very well,” Thopson assumed acceptance, “we’ll
rest that for the present. Now, if you please, I’d like to
take up, with you, the matter of the locked doors.”</p>

<p>Aunt Gracia invited, “Yes. I wish you would.”</p>

<p>I am asking you, Judy, is she a clever woman, or isn’t
she?</p>

<p>“All of the outside doors were locked, on the inside, I
presume, on the night of October eighth?”</p>

<p>“No. We have three outside doors. The side door was
locked, on the inside. Both the front and back doors
were unlocked. Anyone could have come downstairs
and have walked straight out of the house through
either of those doors.”</p>

<p>“Without leaving footprints in the snow?”</p>

<p>“I am sorry,” Aunt Gracia said, “I thought that we
were speaking now only of the doors.”</p>

<p>“Whose duty was it to lock those outside doors at
night?”</p>

<p>“It was no one’s duty. Usually, the last person
downstairs, in the evening, attended to locking the
house.”</p>

<p>“Who was the last person downstairs that night?”</p>

<p>“My brother. That is, he was the last person to retire.
It should have been his care to lock the doors.”</p>

<p>“Would it have been possible for him to have
forgotten to lock them?”</p>

<p>“Very possible. Locked doors are given, or were
given, very little attention on our ranch. I fancy that
we slept many nights with the doors unlocked.”</p>

<p>It seemed to me that, if I had been in Thopson’s
place, I should have asked, then, how it happened, in a
house where locked doors were given no attention, that
there were keys for all the upstairs doors. (Aunt Gracia’s
statement was truthful enough. She had said, “were
given.” A month or so ago, not one of our bedroom
doors had a key to it. Aunt Gracia had had to hunt
them all out from the hardware box in the attic.) Thopson
missed it, however, and went on to ask her to tell
him exactly which doors were locked that night.</p>

<p>“Except for the seven bedroom doors, which were
locked on the outside,” she said, “and for the side door,
downstairs, I think every door in the house was unlocked,
including the inside and outside cellar doors. To
be sure, I had almost forgotten, the door to the back
stairway was locked. Irene Quilter has told you how that
came to be locked.”</p>

<p>“Into what downstairs room,” Thopson inquired,
“does the back stairway lead?”</p>

<p>“Into the sitting room.”</p>

<p>“Not the room in which Mrs. Christopher Quilter
was sleeping that night?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Why, then, did Mrs. Christopher Quilter not unlock
that door, and go up the back stairway, instead of
going through the several downstairs rooms, in order
to use the front stairway?”</p>

<p>“That question is easily answered, Mr. Thopson.
The back stairway is crooked and narrow. We none of
us ever use it. In her terrorized state, my cousin would
surely act according to habit. Her habit was to use the
front stairway.”</p>

<p>Can you sort the truth out of that, Judy? Irene, who
never did any work, and who was never in a hurry,
generally did use the front stairway. The rest of us used
the back stairway as often as we used the front one.
Do you know why Aunt Gracia deliberately lied about
it? I don’t know, entirely. And I don’t know why Irene
did not run right up the back stairway that night. I wish
that I did know. Though, surely, Aunt Gracia might
have been right about Irene’s acting according to habit.
It was her habit to go upstairs the front way, and she
was badly frightened. I guess we’ll have to let it go at
that.</p>

<p>Thopson’s next question was a stunner. “Could you
swear, Miss Quilter, that no member of your family
could have gone into Richard Quilter’s room, committed
the murder, slipped out through the hall and back into
his own room? I understand that the turmoil in the hall
would have covered any slight noise that night.”</p>

<p>For the first time, Aunt Gracia hedged. “I think that
I understand your question, Mr. Thopson; but may I
ask you to state it a bit more directly, so that I may
give a direct answer?”</p>

<p>“Would you swear that there was not time for any
member of your family to have gone into your brother’s
room, committed the murder, and got back into his
own room, before Irene Quilter came into the upper
hall?”</p>

<p>“No. I could not swear to that, because there was
time. I could and do swear, however, that no member
of our family did do what you have suggested because,
though there was time, there was not opportunity.
I make this oath for two reasons. The one reason, I have
given you: No member of our family could have kept
Dick Quilter cowed for five minutes—much less for an
hour or longer. The second reason I have not, as yet,
given to you. It is this: Each member of the Quilter
family was locked in his or her room that night at the
time of the murder. All seven bedroom doors were
locked on the outside. One of the bedrooms was
unoccupied—but that door was also locked. Irene Quilter
found seven keys in my brother’s room, and used one
key to unlock each door. No, Mr. Thopson, we have
more than Irene’s word for that. The keys were left on
the outside of the locks. Only a few minutes later my
father and I turned all those keys again. We did this,
hoping that the murderer might be hiding in one of these
rooms, and that we could keep him locked there while
we searched the remainder of the house.”</p>

<p>“Granted,” Thopson said, “that six of you were
locked in your rooms on that night. There still remains
a seventh, Miss Quilter, who was not locked in her
room.”</p>

<p>Aunt Gracia said: “Mr. Thopson, please be fair about
this. Can you imagine anyone who would plan a murder
by carefully establishing alibis for every person in the
house except herself? Do you suppose that if Irene
Quilter had planned to kill my brother, she would have
arranged to be the one person in the house who was not
locked in a room at the time?”</p>

<p>“Am I unfair when I suggest that plans sometimes
miscarry?”</p>

<p>“No, you are not. That is a fair thing to say. But no
person ever plans a murder so that the burden of
suspicion, even stupid suspicion, falls upon himself. It
would seem, too, Mr. Thopson, that in this instance the
murderer’s carefully laid plans had not miscarried. My
brother is dead. The murderer has escaped—got clear
and away, and, as yet, no one of us has one clue as to his
identity.”</p>

<p>She put it over, Judy. All honour to Aunt Gracia!
Mr. Ward knew better than to say a word when Thopson
signified that he was ready to excuse her. It was she,
the family misfortune, who got the verdict for us—the
verdict that allowed us all to go free.</p>

<p>Thopson called Dr. Joe again. Dr. Joe testified, under
oath, that Father had been given no drug of any sort
that night. Do you suppose that Dr. Joe could salve his
conscience, if he needed to, with the difference between
“had been given no drug” and “had taken no drug”?</p>

<p>As Dr. Joe came back to sit with us, Gus Wildoch and
the two guys who had been at the ranch with him came
sneaking in at the back of the room. They had been
subpœnaed for witnesses, and had been called right
after Dr. Joe—as I should have mentioned. But Hank
had explained that they had sent in word that they
might be a little late, owing to a rush of duties, and
he had proceeded to go along without them. I fancy
that Hank was trying to keep them out of it. Or, perhaps
Gus himself, with his regard for the elder Quilters, was
trying to evade testifying. Their evidence, however, was
certainly not damaging.</p>

<p>Since each of them said the same thing, in almost the
same way, I’ll lump their testimony to save your time
and my space.</p>

<p>They had come with Christopher Quilter, at his request,
to Q 2 Ranch on the morning of Tuesday, October
the ninth. They had seen and had carefully examined the
body of Richard Quilter. He had been shot through the
left chest. Rigor mortis had been complete when they
had arrived. They had inspected the Quilter mansion
and grounds. They couldn’t say as to footprints—the
place was pretty well tracked up by the time they got
there. Gus didn’t “go much on these here footprints,
anyhow—too many ways to get around them, such as
wearing the other fellow’s shoes.” They had been unable
to form any opinions as to who the murderer might be.</p>

<p>Thopson tried none of his baiting with them. The two
deputies, I was later informed, were Gus’s two brothers
who have come recently from Texas, and the three
made rather a formidable trio: combined heights about
nineteen feet; combined weights close to six hundred
pounds.</p>

<p>They were excused, and Hank grew confidential with
the jury. He told them that if they wanted to go into
the other room and talk things over for a few minutes,
they could—he guessed. But he reminded them that
they and he should get home and get their milking and
other chores put through. He guessed that they saw,
as he saw, that a lot of time had been wasted, and that,
“futthermore,” there wasn’t sense nor reason in
fiddle-faddling much longer. Some dirty son of a sea cook had
broken into the Quilter mansion and shot Dick Quilter
and made a getaway. Hank finished by expressing his
deep regret that the law wasn’t able to help the Quilters
out in any way, right now; and, adding his fervent
hope that soon it might be able to lay hands on the
Dutchman, or whatever dirty crook had done it, he
turned the case over to the jury.</p>

<p>If I had been writing a book, I’d have kept their
verdict a dark secret until now. But since I have
sacrificed my literary style to your peace of mind, I have
had to miss my climax.</p>

<p>However, perhaps this will serve: What Aunt Gracia
told the jury, with my comments appended.</p>

<ol>

  <li>Father was the strongest member of the family.

    <p>True a year ago. Not true a week ago.</p></li>

  <li>Father could have disarmed any member of the
      family.

    <p>Doubtful, certainly, a week ago. But, say that he
    could have disarmed any one of us. Would he have
    tried to? Can you see Father jumping at any one of
    us, and snatching a gun from us? I can’t. Judy, you
    and I know that he would have lain there in bed and
    tried to shame us out of our nonsense. Aunt Gracia
    was right about that. He couldn’t have feared a one
    of us. He would have thought that we were staging
    a bluff. Would he have called it? Yes, and for any
    length of time. I can imagine him lying there in bed
    and laughing at us.</p></li>

  <li>Father had not been drugged. He was in full
      possession of all his faculties.

   <p>Is this the truth? Did Dr. Joe lie helpfully?</p></li>

  <li>None of us ever used the back stairway.

   <p>We all used it, except possibly Irene.</p></li>

  <li>Since the murderer was not in our house, he must
      have escaped from it.

   <p>You don’t need me to point the sophistry of that.</p></li>

  <li>We were all locked in our rooms. Proof: Irene found
      seven keys, unlocked seven doors, and left seven keys
      on the outside of the doors.

   <p>There are ten doors in our upper hall. Irene found
   and used seven keys. You can think that out. I’m not
   going to write it. Remember that all the keys to the
   locks in the upper hall are interchangeable. The attic
   door had had no key. It has now. I have brought it
   down from the hardware box in the attic. My one bit
   of sleuthing. But whether that was its first or second
   trip downstairs within the week, it did not say.</p></li>

</ol>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>Judy, I’m not crazy—though sometimes I feel, almost,
as if I were. I am not trying to prove, with this
quibbling, that some member of the Quilter family
shot and killed Father. It seems to me that the single
hope I have left, for anything, is to prove that no
member of the family is a murderer. But I am bound to
be with Grandfather concerning truth. I have to get my
proof through truth—nothing else can satisfy me. I
have to establish Quilter innocence, and reëstablish
Quilter honour, before I can begin to try to establish
anything else.</p>

<p>Aunt Gracia proved Quilter innocence to the six
good men and true. I’d give a thousand of the best
grazing acres on Q 2 to have had her prove it to me. I’d
give more than that. My own life, of course—but it is
not worth shucks. I’d give Lucy’s life, or Grandfather’s,
just as they would give them, for that certainty.</p>

<p>Do you know, I have found one way I can almost get
it. My way hasn’t anything to do with ropes, or keys,
or coal oil. It hasn’t anything to do with footprints, or
motives, or drugs.</p>

<p>I do this. I take us, one at a time. I begin with
Grandfather, and I come straight through the list to Lucy. I
stop at each name. I think. I put into that thinking
every particle of knowledge I have concerning each
person, and I keep out of it every particle of prejudice
and every atom of affection or of admiration. I judge
them as objectively as I judge cattle for buying or
breeding. Each time I do it, I come out with a clean slate.
That method, and nothing else, gives me my certainty,
my sure knowledge that not one of the Quilter family
could be guilty of crime.</p>

<p>And that, after consideration, I am bound to state is
a lie. It gives me my certainty—with one exception.
That is why I don’t go after it more often. That is why
I am afraid of my certainty. Each time, more positively
than the last, it omits one person. Probably you don’t
need to have me tell you who the one person is. Neal
Quilter.</p>

<p>Neal Quilter could have done it. Suppose that he had.
Suppose that he had planned the thing keenly, as it was
planned, from beginning to end. And then, as Aunt
Gracia said, since we are dealing with suppositions,
suppose that the horror of having done such a thing should
have driven him clear out of his mind; should have
caused a real brain storm—so that, when the storm had
cleared, he had forgotten every incident connected with
the crime.</p>

<p>I wish I knew more about minds. I wish I knew
whether a thing of the sort ever had happened or ever
could happen. Chris says that great strides in psychology
are to be made within the next decade. I tried to pump
him about it, since he is interested in the subject. But
of course, since I was unwilling to say to him what I
have said to you, I got no real satisfaction. Still, since
it is recognizedly possible that a man may forget his
entire past, including his own name, and continue to
go about as a fairly normal person, I don’t see why it
should be impossible for him to forget, entirely, some
one particular horror.</p>

<p>Granting the amnesia, I could have done it. I could
have gone upstairs some time in the late afternoon and
fixed that rope on the bed, and collected the keys from
the inside of the doors. (Where I got a gun, and what I
did with it afterwards, are, of course, other things I
would have forgotten. I can reconstruct with the
material now at hand. I cannot remember.) Then, on
Monday night, before Father put out his light, I could
have stepped across the hall to his room. If I had gone
in there, threatening him with a gun, do you think he’d
have jumped out of bed and taken the gun away from
me? I think not. Aunt Gracia was night about that.
Father would not have been afraid of any one of us.
Why, even I would laugh if any member of our family
came dodging into my room flourishing a gun. Or,
perhaps I should say, even I, a week ago, would have
laughed.</p>

<p>But we’ll say I didn’t show my gun. We’ll say that I
kept it in my back pocket for an hour or so while we
talked, Father and I. If I had decided to kill him rather
than allow him to go insane, I might have desired a long,
confirmatory talk. Unless the rope is clear outside the
whole affair of the murder—as Chris still insists—we
can no longer suppose that I had meant to shoot Chris,
and shot Father by mistake. That hour, with the rope
out across the porch roof, has to be accounted for.</p>

<p>I might have fixed the rope at eleven o’clock, deciding
that I would use it in the next five minutes. And, after
that, something might have caused me to delay for
another hour. The rope hocus-pocus certainly would
not have caused Father to take either me or my
threats any more seriously. Can’t you imagine the
conversation?</p>

<p>“What are you planning to do with the clothes-line,
my son?”</p>

<p>“I am going to use it to escape out of the window
after I have shot you.”</p>

<p>We know that Father would have laughed at me;
unless, of course, he had decided that I had gone mad.
In that case, he might have started to get out of bed
to take the gun away from me.</p>

<p>Well, then, I had the rope fixed, we’ll say. I shot
Father. I went to the window and discovered the snow.
I knew that the rope could not be used, then, because the
footprints on the roof would betray me. What might I
have done? It is absurdly simple. I might have stepped
across the hall to my own room and locked myself
in—<em>with the key to the attic door</em>. Yes, as I have said, I
have since found the key in the hardware box in the
attic. But if Grandfather, or Aunt Gracia, had
discovered an extra key in my room, when they were
searching the house, would they have declaimed
concerning it, or would they have hidden it away in the
box?</p>

<p>Why I should have had the key, if I had planned the
rope escape, I can’t think. Why I should have planned
the rope, I can’t think. I might have had some wily
scheme, involving both the key and the rope. Or the
entire idea of the rope might have been one of the
fool mistakes that murderers, according to the best
traditions, always make. Leaving the door between my
room and Lucy’s unlocked would seem, certainly, to
have been another mistake.</p>

<p>The question of time is a nice one. I needed, after the
shot was fired, to have looked out of the window,
crossed the full width of Father’s room, got across the
hall and into my own room, locked the door, picked up
a chair, and battered the door with it. Lucy needed to
have got out of bed, put on her slippers, lighted her lamp,
run across her room to my door, opened it. It might
work out. I don’t know. I think that I couldn’t have
done my part of it in two minutes. Then I remember
how long two minutes were when you were taking
Greg’s temperature.</p>

<p>On the whole, the time seems to be against me. What
I could have done with the gun seems to be for me.
When I remember how this house was searched, it
seems impossible that I could have hidden a gun anywhere
in it. It certainly would have been found. I could
not have thrown it out of a window. We’d have seen it
in the snow. Though, after all, I have a good baseball
arm; I might have thrown it out of Father’s open
window. No, that’s nonsense. It would have been found,
long before this. However, the fact that the gun is gone
doesn’t weigh very heavily against the facts that no
one got out of the house that night and that no one was
hiding in the house that night.</p>

<p>I suppose you might suggest that Chris was as capable
of the crime as I was. It won’t do. Chris loved Father:
not enough to kill him rather than have him lose that
splendid mind of his, but too much to kill him for any
other reason. Father had stopped opposing the sale of
the ranch. Chris had Father’s ill health and overwork
on this place to use as an excuse for selling us out. He
had Father’s ability as a rancher to salve his conscience
if he stuck us on some dinky valley truck farm. Also,
Chris is a rank sentimentalist and—may I say
consequently—something of a coward.</p>

<p>Yet, when I go to calling Chris names, I suspect that
I should go softly. I have wondered, these last few days,
whether instead of fighting what I have always decried
as Quilter sentimentality, I have been fighting, merely,
a subtle sensitiveness, an ability for loving, which I
have been too boorish to possess or to understand. The
thought of marrying some queen and giving her a right
to paw over me and call me “Boofel,” nauseates me.
Look at Uncle Phineas tethered to Olympe. Look at
Chris deeded to Irene! You and Greg are different;
but you are friends. You bake your bread, instead of
feasting on the yeast. And—you are a Quilter woman.
But what I started to say was, that I have wondered
whether this lack of sentimentality in me denoted
simply a hard streak, a streak of yellow, perhaps a
streak of cruelty.</p>

<p>I’ve wondered, too, if the fact that Father killed that
cur a few months before I was born, and that Mother
saw him do it, might have made me different. People
seem to think that prenatal influences are important.
I have never believed it, because it seems to me if that
were true of people it would be true of animals. Still,
what do I know about it? Or about anything? There is
this: I don’t feel as if I were incapable of love, if love is
the rather tremendously serious, and yet, someway,
the very humorous, clutching feeling I have for the
family and for Q 2. But I do feel as if talking about it,
showing it off as Irene and Chris show it off, defiled it.</p>

<p>There is Aunt Gracia, to-day, and the feeling I have
about her. She sat there, lying under oath, to save the
Quilter family; to save, I know, either Irene and Chris
or Irene and me. There isn’t one of us, I suppose, who
would not have been willing to sacrifice his own honour,
peace of mind, and the rest, to such a cause. But, by
Jove, I think Aunt Gracia is the only one of us who is
brave enough to sacrifice eternity. I know exactly what
she did to-day. Should I go to her and spiel a lot of
mushy stuff about loving her for it? Should I cheapen
her magnificence to gratify my own emotionalism?
Should I write my name in red pencil on the base of a
marble column?</p>

<p>In other words—what a good boy am I! Sitting here,
teetering with tragedy, and revelling in congratulatory
self-analysis. Ask me this, Judy. Ask me why I have not
mentioned again the important fact that was brought
out during to-day’s inquisition? That is, why I have so
carefully avoided further discussion of the fact that
Father’s death may bring to his family a payment of
ten thousand needed dollars? Should you believe me if
I told you that, for the last several hours, I had
forgotten it? I hope you are too sensible to believe that.
Ask me why, just now, when I was making out the case
against myself, I did not mention a ten-thousand-dollar
motive? Ten thousand dollars would mean
enough money for Irene and Chris to go where they
please, with enough left over to carry Q 2 through to
safety. I remarked, during the inquest, that I had not
known about the accident policy. I seemed to be
believed. I seem to have believed myself——</p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p class="dateline">Later.</p>

<p>Sorry, Judy dear. I am a fool. Even this forgetting
business would, I suppose, need to stop somewhere. I
had not known about the policy. And talking is rot.
My apology, if you’ll have it, is that Father’s death has
been a knockout. I’ve been feeling too much—unaccustomed
feelings. I have been thinking, or trying to
think, until my brain has worn out from effort.</p>

<p>I am all right again now. I’ve been out with Uncle
Phineas walking and waiting for the sunrise. He is all
cut up, torn up about Father. And yet, somehow, the
fact that he was not here on Monday night, and that he
didn’t have the horror of that first hour, seems to make
him more wholesome, saner than any of us.</p>

<p>He was here at home when we got back from the inquest
last evening. He came running down the path to
meet us, with tears washing out of his eyes and all over
his cheeks, but he was paying no more attention to them
than he would have paid to rain. He is one of us—a
Quilter straight through—and neck deep in trouble
with us. But it is as if he had come in, on purpose, while
the rest of us have been chucked in.</p>

<p>Olympe was out of bed, when we came from Quilterville
yesterday, as chipper as you please in Aunt Gracia’s
best kitchen dress with a little doily of an apron. She
actually had helped Lucy prepare supper for the three
of them. Olympe would be correctly costumed for the
frying of ham and eggs.</p>

<p>(Dr. Joe has envoys scouring Chinatown for Dong
Lee, but he is not to be discovered. He was to have
stayed a week; so we know that he’ll be back on Monday;
but we could do with him sooner. It is tough for
Aunt Gracia, this having him gone just now.)</p>

<p>While the rest of us were getting a pick-up supper in
the kitchen, Olympe disappeared. Sure enough, in a
few minutes, here she came, wearing that black lace rig
of hers, with the red roses and red velvet loops ripped
off of it. A pity, since, by that time, Lucy and I were
the only ones who had stayed downstairs.</p>

<p>Olympe stopped in the kitchen doorway and asked
us where Pan was. We told her that he had gone to
Grandfather’s room with him. She trailed forward to
the table, delivered the first part of her “God help the
Quilter wives” speech, and turned to sweep from the
room. Lucy laughed.</p>

<p>You see, in her haste to get into mourning, Olympe
had forgotten the back of her gown. Do you remember
its long, square train, caught up in two places with great
blobs of a horrible shade of red velvet and red roses?
She had forgotten to remove them.</p>

<p>It was not amusing. Lucy laughed, as you know, not
in spite of our trouble, but because of it. If Lucy had
not been all to pieces, unnerved and half hysterical, she
could no more have laughed at anything about Olympe
than she could have cat-called in church. I don’t recall
that any of us children were taught that we must never
laugh at Olympe. And yet, of course, laughing at her
has always been one of the major Quilter heresies.</p>

<p>Olympe wheeled about. She was so white that the
little dabs of rouge on her cheekbones looked as if they
might tumble off. I went and stood close to Lucy.</p>

<p>Olympe said, “Are you laughing at me?”</p>

<p>I tried to tell her that Lucy was not laughing. That
she was all to pieces, hysterical, and did not know what
she was doing.</p>

<p>“She may not know,” Olympe said, “but I know that
she is laughing at me. Why? Because I am old, and
weak, and no longer beautiful; because my husband
humiliates me, and neglects me.”</p>

<p>She trailed away then, riding the trimmings on her
train. Lucy, of course, burst into tears.</p>

<p>I have gone well around Robin Hood’s barn, with all
this. I wanted to give you something as a sample,
perhaps as an excuse for what I am going to ask you to
do.</p>

<p>Judy, I want you to write and insist on having Lucy
come to you for a time. Don’t hint that it is for Lucy’s
sake. Lucy is too game to desert. Say that it is for your
sake. Say that you need her to help you with Greg—so
on. I don’t need to dictate your letter, but make it
strong. I’ll manage her railway fare, somehow or other.
She has to get away from here for the present.</p>

<p>She is twelve years old, imaginative and impressionable.
We have been fools to leave her alone so much with
Olympe, here of late. I don’t need to tell you how
brave and sensible Lucy usually is. She will come
through even this all right, if we give her half a chance.
She won’t get the half chance, here, now, with Olympe
treating her to scenes like the one last evening, and
telling her—the Lord knows what, and making her
promise not to tell. The kid has something extra on her
mind. And, though Lucy won’t tell me, I am darn sure
it was Olympe who loaded it there. I couldn’t insist
that Lucy break a promise. But can you imagine anyone
who would be fool enough to add the burden of a
secret and a promise to Lucy’s troubles right now?</p>

<p>When this afternoon is over—the funeral is to be this
afternoon—I am going to Olympe about it. Not that I
think it will amount to a hill of beans; but, since we
won’t be able to get Lucy to you for a week or so, I’ll
have to get things straightened out for her in the
meantime.</p>

<p>She is scared, Judy, Lucy is. When I got her quieted
down, last night, I urged her to go upstairs to bed.
She wouldn’t go. She said that she was lonesome alone,
and that she wanted to stay with me. Then, of a
sudden, you know how she lights and flashes, she said:
“That is a story, Neal. I’ve turned coward. Please don’t
tell Grandfather. I am afraid to go upstairs and stay
alone in my room.”</p>

<p>I fixed her a fine bed, and screened it off from the
light, on the sitting-room sofa. And, gosh knows, I
shouldn’t have thought it strange, even from Lucy, if
she had begun to be afraid a bit sooner—the first night
or the second. I can’t pretend that any of us has been
entirely without something that at least approximated
fear. Grandfather has locked the place himself, each
night. And, as you know, I have stayed up all night,
on guard, every night this week. (Chris offered to spell
me, but I’ve liked the quiet nights for writing to you.
I have needed the job badly, so I have liked it.) No,
Lucy’s fear would have been natural enough, if it had
begun sooner. Coming now, it must mean that whatever
fool thing Olympe told her yesterday, and made
her promise not to tell, has frightened her. With this
added to the rest, I am sure you’ll agree with me that
we must get Lucy right away from here.</p>

<p>Aunt Gracia is in the kitchen attending to breakfast.
I’ll go and cadge an advance snack, and then I’ll ride
into Quilterville with this in time to get it off on
Number Twenty-four.</p>

<p><span class="sal">Dear Judy:</span>
We buried Father to-day. To gratify
Aunt Gracia, we had the Siloamite ceremony. They
did the best they could to re-break our hearts, if that
could have been possible. Since mummery is not always
ineffective, there should be a law decreeing that no one
but a man’s enemies be allowed to attend his funeral.</p>

<p>The entire county was there, I think. There were
ponderously perfumed flowers, tortured into unnatural
shapes, over which furry, caterpillarish-looking letters
writhed into words, “At Rest,” and such originalities.</p>

<p>When we came home neighbours had been here and
had done strange, geometrically unfamiliar things to
the rooms, and had left a table spread with an astonishing
repast in odd dishes, which we never use. Nothing
was lacking, you see, from the best funereal traditions—not
even the baked meats. Nothing was lacking, except
any sense of the fitness of things, or of the comfort of
finality, or the dignity of death, or the realization that
we are a supposedly civilized people, living in the year
1900 <span class="sc">A. D.</span></p>

<p>Sorry, Judy. I am not fit to write this evening. I am
going to bed to-night. If Chris wishes to keep up this
fool night herding he may. I am through.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="dateline">Sunday, October 14, 1900.</p>

<p><span class="sal">Dear Judy:</span>
Dr. Joe came home with us last
evening, and spent the night here. This afternoon
he talked to Grandfather, Uncle Phineas, Chris,
and me.</p>

<p>He had heard from Mr. Ward, who had been to see
the insurance people. He said that they were inclined
to hedge. They had hoped to have it proved that
Father’s death was suicidal. Mr. Ward writes, however,
that they haven’t a legal leg to stand on, and that he
thinks he will have the money for us within two weeks.</p>

<p>Grandfather asked me whether I had thought about
what you and Lucy and I would do with the money. I
had not, of course. I hadn’t realized that the money
would come to the three of us. I told Grandfather we’d
do whatever he advised. He said we should have to
think it over. We dropped the discussion there.</p>

<p>This evening, when he got me alone, Chris said, flat,
that I should have to let him have five thousand dollars.
That is, he said if I’d pay the Brindley mortgage so
that he could get another mortgage to the extent of five
thousand dollars, that would satisfy him. But, in some
way, he had to have at least five thousand at
once—enough for Irene and him to get back to New York and
live until he had made a success of his writing. Otherwise,
he said, he should be forced to accept the offer he had for
selling the place. He was certain that I would understand
why he could not ask Irene to remain on Q 2 Ranch.
No man, he said, could ask any sensitive woman to
continue life in a place where such a horror had occurred.</p>

<p>I said, “Shall we cast lots for the garments, Chris?”
and walked away. But it isn’t as decent as that. It is
refined blackmailing—though I don’t know why I
modify it.</p>

<p>If we do get the money, he’ll get his five thousand,
won’t he, Judy? Cheap at the price, to be rid of them.
The other five thousand will carry us along to safety.</p>

<p>In passing, I wonder whether Irene knew that Chris
wouldn’t expect or ask her to stay on a place where a
horror had occurred? Sorry. That is spite—cad’s
talk—nothing else.</p>

<p>Thank the Lord we’ll get Lucy away from this rotten,
spite-ridden, fear-ridden hole before long. I wish we
might get Grandfather away for a while, too. He has
aged, in the past week. I wish, also, that I could keep
him from finding out about this last brash move of
Chris’s, but I don’t know how to do it.</p>

<p>I’m foundered on this writing business, Judy. It is
doing no good. I think I shall pass it up. But I do want
to tell you that I have decided I was clear off about
Grandfather’s suspecting me. I surely had a
brainstorm, right, there for a few days.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p class="dateline">Monday, October 15, 1900.</p>

<p><span class="sal">Dear Judy:</span>
Your letter in answer to my first one to
you came this morning. I’m glad that you think I did
right when I told you the truth. But I am sorry that
you thought my purpose in writing to you was to gain
comfort and consolation for myself.</p>

<p>It is gratifying, of course, to know that you are sure
I did not go into Father’s room and murder him in cold
blood. Gratifying, too, to be assured that you can’t
believe I murdered Father, not even by mistake for
Chris. As a matter of fact, I had reached both
conclusions some time ago.</p>

<p>Your judgment, from a few thousand miles of distance,
that we were all mistaken about nobody hiding
in the house, and, probably, all mistaken about there
being no footprints in the snow, is also reassuring. And
nothing could be more inspirational than your repeated
assertion that, until I come to my senses and realize
that no member of the family <em>could possibly</em> have done
such a wicked thing, I’ll be useless as an aid in discovering
the real criminal. Too, your persistent demands that
I stop being foolish, hysterical, and begin to think
calmly and sanely and search for “clues” (Lord, Jude,
that searching for clues came near to being the last
straw!), and evolve some sensible theory and some
reasonable plan of action, have been carefully noted.</p>

<p>Sorry, but to date I have evolved no such theory or
plan. However, other members of the family have been
less dilatory. I shall give you the two theories in vogue
at present. You may have them to play with, but I
should advise against your putting them in your
mouth, because, I fear, they might rub off and give you
a tummy ache.</p>

<p>The first theory was constructed by Olympe and is,
I believe, exclusively her own. It was this theory which
succeeded in frightening Lucy—I had given the child
credit for much better sense—out of her wits. At Lucy’s
earnest solicitation, Olympe graciously allowed Lucy
to repeat the production to me. The author, modestly,
declined a direct discussion of it.</p>

<p>Lucy tells me that she has enlightened you, to some
extent, concerning a gentleman unfortunately named
Archie Biggil—ex-husband of Irene’s. That she has
told you of his, perhaps belated, ardency; of his
jealousy, his passion, and other interesting emotions.
Sweet stuff for a kid like Lucy to have been consuming!</p>

<p>Olympe thinks that this Archie Biggil came, armed
to the teeth, with great stealth, in the deep darkness of
the night, to Q 2 Ranch. She thinks that he wore a
red mask; that he crept into Father’s room and shot
him, not, as you may be supposing by mistake for
Chris—though that, too, would involve one or two
minor discrepancies, such as the fact that Archie, not
having known of the changed rooms, would have been
unapt to make such a mistake—but out of revenge for
the unhappiness that Irene had undergone on Q 2.</p>

<p>Olympe advances that Archie, thoroughly provoked,
had intended a sort of holocaust, or general slaughter
of the Quilters. But, possibly due to his astonishment
at having the first murder prove such a noisy
undertaking, he had temporarily, though immediately,
desisted. He had rushed into the hall. He had met Irene,
who, overcome with some emotion (joy? fright? horror?
astonishment?), had experienced but one impulse—to
wit, the getting of Archie under cover. She had herded
him into the attic. She had locked him in one of her
trunks for safekeeping! (Your penchant for underscoring
permits me only the modest exclamation point.
That sentence bravely deserves more.)</p>

<p>Irene’s three large trunks in the attic were locked.
They were not searched. They have never, to my
knowledge, been searched. Since Olympe has never
helped in our searchings, I do not know how she
happened to be aware of the locked, unsearched trunks.
Evidently, someone has told her of them.</p>

<p>To continue, and to repeat, Irene locked the irritable
Archie in one of her trunks and returned below stairs
to discover, for the first time, what it was that Archie
had been up to. Again, the range of her possible
emotions is a wide one. We may assume that her sense of
tact soon predominated. Disliking to be involved in
the affair, she simply left Archie locked in the trunk.
Though, in due time, Olympe seems to prophesy, Irene
will relent and unlock Archie.</p>

<p>You may judge what the past week had done to Lucy,
when you realize that she could admit junk of this sort
into that straight-thinking mind of hers. It makes me
ill. Almost as ill as it makes me to wonder why Olympe
was so badly in need of a theory that she should proffer
this one.</p>

<p>The second theory, given as the joint production of
Grandfather and Uncle Phineas, is more ingenuous.</p>

<p>They say they believe that the murderer came to the
house sometime shortly after dark, probably while we
were all at supper. That he came in the front door and
went upstairs. This, I admit, would have been risky,
but possible. The front of the house, the hall, the
upstairs, were all dark. They have provided the man with
a dark lantern of the type that burglars are supposed
to carry.</p>

<p>At that time, he could have collected the keys in the
upper hall, and gone upstairs to the attic. It was, they
think, while he was hiding in the attic that the idea of
the rope swung out of the window first came to him.
Uncle Phineas makes the picture: The villain crouching,
the coil of rope near at hand. He had, so the story goes,
while he was making his other plans about locking us
all in our rooms, made also his plan of escape. But the
coil of rope brought fresh inspirations—a plan for
misleading us. He took the rope, crept downstairs again,
tied it around the leg of the bed, moved the bed a bit
to make us believe that the rope had been used as a
means of escape down the side of the house to the
ground. He counted on it to send us all rushing from the
house in hot pursuit of him. And, they say, but for the
snow this plan of his would, probably, have accomplished
his purpose. (Yes, you bet. But for the snow.
And but for the man’s forehandedness in tossing the
rope out of the window at least an hour, perhaps two
hours before he got around to the shooting.) However,
since the rope had been merely an afterthought, the
snow made no difference in his original plan of escape.</p>

<p>This plan, they have decided, must have been to get
out of Father’s room into some safe, previously
arranged hiding place in the house. Why, with us all
locked in our rooms, and with no snow to betray him
with footprints, he should have planned to stay in
hiding in the house, instead of planning to run right
down either stairway and out of the house and away,
I don’t know. The fact that he could not have done
this, that Irene was downstairs with the stairway doors
locked, need not make any difference in the speculations
as to what his original plans may have been.
He had not, certainly, planned to have Irene locked
out of her room. But Grandfather and Uncle Phineas,
wedded to the notion of the rope as a “false clue,”
insist that, because he wanted us out of the house
hunting for him he must have planned to stay in the
house.</p>

<p>After the deed, the murderer returned, posthaste, to
the attic. He left the attic door unlocked. You may
choose your answer to that from the following
suggestions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>He had left the key in the hardware box by
      mistake.</li>
  <li>He thought that an unlocked door would allay
      suspicion.</li>
  <li>His hiding place in the attic was so secure that
      an unlocked door, or two, made no difference to
      him.</li>
</ol>

<p>Here, Jude, is where you can come into your own.
You are certain that we left some part of the house
unsearched. You are right. Until late this afternoon, no
one had searched—the roof.</p>

<p>Since the fact that there is no way to get up on the
roof except through the trapdoor, directly in the centre
of the attic roof and about eleven feet from the floor,
seems to bother no one, it need not bother you.</p>

<p>The stepladder, that Monday night when we
searched the attic, was nowhere near the trapdoor.
There was no box, or chest, or anything else that could
have been used to reach the trapdoor, anywhere near
it. In answer to Uncle Phineas’s question as to whether
I could swear that none of these things had been moved
beneath the trapdoor and, afterwards, put back into
place—of course I could not. I could swear that nothing
appeared to be out of place that night in the attic. I
could swear that, if any object, large or small, had been
directly in the centre of the attic, beneath the trapdoor,
both Grandfather and I should have seen it instantly.
But, that, also, is of no consequence; because, according
to our most popular theory, this is what happened:</p>

<p>The murderer had moved the stepladder, had ascended
it, had opened the trapdoor and got out on the
roof. Since the trapdoor claps shut when it is not held,
he had fastened it open and had left—— What? Why, a
rope, of course, dangling. He had then descended the
ladder and had replaced it against the wall of the room
up there. Next, he had stolen downstairs and committed
the murder. He had then returned to the attic,
climbed up the rope to the roof, pulled the rope up after
him, and closed the trapdoor. In short, just give that
guy enough rope and there was nothing he could not do
with it, from fixing “false clues” to climbing eleven feet
of it, dangling loose, and excluding, only, hanging
himself with it.</p>

<p>Once he found himself on the ten-by-twelve flat
piece of roof, he regarded his escape as having been
perfectly effected. All that remained for him to do,
after that, was to wait until he got ready, climb down
his rope again, come down through the house and
walk out of it.</p>

<p>In case you don’t like to have him walk out through
the locked and doubly guarded doors, you may have
this: He stayed above, fluctuating between the roof
and the attic, for four or five days. That is, until Friday,
when we all except Olympe and Lucy had gone to the
inquest; or until Saturday, when we all had gone to the
funeral. On either of those days, the snow was melted;
so he could have got out of a window, or jumped off the
roof, or climbed down his rope from the roof—couldn’t
he?—and walked away.</p>

<p>The question of his food and water for five days has,
also, a nice variety of answers. I prefer my own: That
he ate his rope, and washed it down with snow water
from the roof—the special snow that did not come down
through the open trapdoor into the attic. You see, if the
trapdoor had been left open for any length of time from
ten minutes to two hours, during the snowstorm, there
would have been snow or melted snow on the attic
floor. Do you think that would have escaped both
Grandfather and me when we were searching the attic?
I know that it would not. I know that if anyone had got
down off that dirty, wet roof, even once, he would have
left footprints on Aunt Gracia’s spotless floor up there.
The floor that night looked as it usually looks; that is,
very much like the bread board.</p>

<p>Unfortunately—I quote the elders—Aunt Gracia this
morning thought that the weather was threatening and
chose to have Dong Lee (he came home last night, garishly
dentilated, politely sympathetic, but, seemingly,
unperturbed) hang the washing in the attic instead of
in the yard. This necessitated the usual cleaning and
dusting of the attic. This late afternoon it was impossible
to tell, by coatings of dust or the like, whether
ladder, chests, boxes, had been recently moved.</p>

<p>Much as she disliked the admission, Aunt Gracia was
forced to say that nothing in the attic seemed to have
been disturbed; that no traces, even of the most
immaculate intruder, had been discoverable. Said Uncle
Phineas, no traces of the criminal were to be found in
the attic. Said he, any halfway clever criminal would,
of course, have removed all traces before leaving the
attic.</p>

<p>Finis, then? The attic itself could scarcely be neater
and cleaner than this explanation. All that remains to be
explained is why Grandfather, Uncle Phineas, Aunt
Gracia, and Chris declare that they credit such sort of
stuff. And why do they leave me out in the cold with
Olympe, Irene, and Lucy?</p>

<p>Stretching a long, long bow I might give Uncle
Phineas and, perhaps, Chris credit for honesty when
they declare their belief in this nonsense. I know darn
well that Aunt Gracia does not believe in it, not for one
of her clear-sighted seconds. I know that Grandfather
cannot believe it; unless—well, Grandfather is eighty
years old, and this week has been a week of steady
torture for him.</p>

<p>Reverting, again, to your letter. What I seem to have
said about attending the hanging of Father’s murderer
has, apparently, shocked you severely. I was one little
bloodthirsty lad, wasn’t I, when I wrote that first letter
to you? The scarcely gradual tapering of my tone from
vengeance to vacuity must prove at least amusing to
you. But, at least, I am not a clutching backslider. I
state, conclusively, that I no longer have any desire
either to discover Father’s murderer or to attend any
hanging whatsoever. Quite, quite the contrary. I won’t
subscribe to the darn fool lies the others are propounding.
But I’d give the spring heifers if I could concoct
some lucid, logical lie that would clear the Quilter
family.</p>

<p>You say that I asked you to help me in ferreting out
the criminal. That should speak volumes for my own
condition at the time I wrote. I judge that the sheer
shock of the thing reduced me on the instant to a
drooling, chattering idiot—swearing my innocence to
you, beseeching for your reassurance. You have given
it, Jude; lots of it and lavishly—the reassurance. Shall
we let it go at that? But, as for the help, I shall have to
change my order. Can you, by any effort of wits, produce
the lie we are all so seriously needing at present?</p>

<p>Remember, any compound must include that rope.
Do you know, sometimes I almost incline to agree with
Chris’s ex-theory—that the rope was, somehow,
coincidental. Deserting fiction, for the moment, and
attempting fact: Can you think of any conceivable reason
that Father himself might have had for tossing that
rope out of the window early in the night? Suppose that
Aunt Gracia’s suggestion about a blackmailer was truer
than she thought. Might it have been possible that
Father helped him—or anyone—to <em>get into</em> his room
that night by means of the rope? Someone, with a fair
amount of agility, might have been able to get from the
ground to the porch roof by means of the porch pillars
and the rope. This would have had to be, of course,
before the snowfall started. It is at least possible that,
since the rope had been effectual for an entrance, it
might have been left in place as an exit. The window’s
having been left open would seem peculiar, on so cold a
night; peculiar, but not impossible. The impossible
element in any of this is the implication that Father
could have been induced to stoop to underhandedness
or secrecy of any sort.</p>

<p>Aunt Gracia spoke about unknown paragraphs and
pages in men’s lives. It went with the jury. Let it go.
But it brings us back again to fiction. My thinking
machine—I realize that this is in no sense an admission—is
not, at present, in working order. You take the rope
as a means of access instead of exit and see whether
you can produce something that will serve for our
present needs.</p>

<p><span class="sal">Dear Judy:</span>
When I wrote to you, day before
yesterday, I thought that I was through with
this letter writing. I wrote, then, in the rôle of Mr.
Wise-guy, scorning you and the rest of the family for not
serenely knowing that one of the Quilters was a murdering
cur. Scorning even Grandfather; or, if not quite as
brash as that, accusing him of senility for using that
brave old mind of his to reach for the truth. No use of
my trying it; no use of my loyalty to the family being
stronger than the absence of footprints in the snow. I
was going on nineteen years old, wasn’t I? Why shouldn’t
I be the only wise, honest one in the group? Even
poor old Olympe did better than I. She tried to think of
an explanation. It was no good, and she was ashamed of
it. But she tried, and hoped that Lucy’s clear little mind
might help with it. Not smart-aleck Neal. He knew.
There is no good in raving, Judy. But, gosh, I am so
sick of myself that I feel exactly as I did that time when
Whatof and I got in a mix-up with the skunk.</p>

<p>No, we haven’t found the murderer. But something
happened last night that proves, about as clearly as
anything but finding him and hearing his confession
could prove, that not one of the family was involved in
the dirty business. Go on, Judy dear, crow! You can’t
crow any louder than I wish I had a right to.</p>

<p>Here is the story: Yesterday afternoon Uncle Phineas
left, again, for Portland. This may seem sort of queer to
you; but it isn’t. I can’t explain it, right now. It is a
secret that Uncle Phineas and I have had together for
a long time. But next week, at the latest, he hopes to
be able to tell the family. As yet he hasn’t told even
Grandfather or Olympe.</p>

<p>I was sorry he couldn’t see his way clear to confiding
in Olympe, because his going right away again hurt her
feelings like everything. He couldn’t take her with him
on account of our being so hard up for ready money,
just now. Uncle Phineas shares Dr. Joe’s room in
Portland. If he had taken Olympe they would have had
to go to a hotel, and we couldn’t afford it. All this, then,
to explain why Olympe returned to her bed, to stay,
after Uncle Phineas left yesterday afternoon.</p>

<p>At six-thirty Aunt Gracia was going to send Olympe’s
supper tray up to her by Lucy, but I carried it instead.
I am darn glad that I did, for now I know what I know.
She seemed so forlorn that I sat down and talked to her
while she ate her supper.</p>

<p>She was not in a sunny humour. She has been a bit
miffed with me, for one thing, ever since I questioned
her about the gun. Too, she was all cut up about Uncle
Phineas’s leaving her alone again, as she said, “at a time
like this.” She has fully determined that he goes solely
and wholly because he cannot bear to be on the place
while “that young person,” as she calls Irene, is here.</p>

<p>I didn’t stay with her any longer than seemed necessary.
When she had eaten her supper, she asked me to
search her room before I left her alone in it. To humour
her, I made a thorough job of it. I looked under the bed
and the sofa, in the closet, behind the curtains, and I
even opened her old Flemish chest and stirred through
it. She asked me, next, to put her wrapper handy, so
that she could slip into it when she got up to lock the
door after me. I told her that someone would be coming
up, directly after supper, to keep her company and
then she’d have to get out of bed and unlock the door
again. She said that she would not stay a moment
alone in the house unless she were certain that every
window and door was locked. (I grinned to myself. One
of her windows was three inches down from the top,
right then, as Uncle Phineas always has it when he is at
home. I had left it like that because I thought the fresh
air would be good for her headache. That stuffy, purple
and brown, verbena and liniment atmosphere that
always pervades Olympe’s room would give me a
headache at any time.) She said, also, that she was
in no humour for company this evening. You know
Olympe’s “Tired, ill, and old” speech—or perhaps you
don’t. It seems to me that has been devised since you
left. At any rate, she was unfit for companionship. She
was, as soon as I left her, going to take some of the
drops Dr. Joe had given her. She hoped, merely hoped,
for a little sleep. So, if I would please, ask the others to
walk quietly when they came through the hall on the
way to bed?</p>

<p>I promised to deliver the message, took her tray and
went into the hall. I put it on the stand, and went into
the bathroom to clean up a bit. As I walked through the
hall I noticed—I am certain of this—that all the doors
were standing ajar except the attic door, your door,
and the door to Father’s room. When I came out of the
bathroom, I picked up the tray and went downstairs,
using the back stairway.</p>

<p>The folks were sitting down to supper when I went
into the dining room. I apologized to Grandfather for
being late. Dong Lee came in with a tray of muffins,
and hung around to hear them praised. Aunt Gracia and
Lucy remarked on their excellence. Chris asked how
Olympe was feeling. I answered, and delivered her
message about quiet in the hall. Irene produced a none
too gentle remark concerning Olympe’s deafness. Chris,
as usual—one does sort of have to feel sorry for Chris
at times—tried to cover it with an observation about
the mantel clock’s being slow. Aunt Gracia thought
not, and asked Grandfather for the correct time.
Grandfather took out his watch, opened it, said that it was
two minutes after seven——</p>

<p>Just at that moment, with every last one of us right
there around the dining table, the sound of a gunshot
crashed through the house. It was precisely and exactly
one too many shots for most of us.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>The next thing I knew, I was running up the back
stairs, listening to a beast growling in my own throat.
Since running down the hall, straight to Olympe’s room,
was the sensible thing to have done, I can’t understand
why I did it, then; but I did. I was the first one to reach
her door. It was open. I ran into her room. She was in
bed. Her night lamp was lighted on the table beside her.
She is all right, Judy; don’t be frightened. She is as
sound as she ever was, untouched by anything worse
than a bad scare.</p>

<p>But I did not know it when I ran to her. The others,
who came crowding in, didn’t know it, either. I thought
that, like Father, she had been shot and killed. I thought
it so certainly that, when I touched her she felt cold;
and, for one wild, red second, I saw soaking blood. I am
stopping to tell you this in order to show you what
sort of tricks my mind and senses will play on me. It is
a lesson about trusting either of them too far. Even yet,
I find myself thinking that Olympe is dead, and I have
to stop and remember painstakingly that she is not.</p>

<p>I heard Aunt Gracia’s voice declaring that Olympe
was not hurt. I heard the words, but for all the meaning
they conveyed she might have been reciting the
multiplication tables. The experience has surely taught me
much concerning cowardice. How can a fellow be blamed
for anything when fear, through no volition of his,
throttles him and robs him of all his faculties? Not, you
understand, that I was afraid the fellow was going to
pop out from somewhere and shoot me; such a thought
never entered my mind, then. I wasn’t afraid, either,
that he was going to appear and shoot some one of the
others. I was afraid of what had happened, I suppose—if
you can find sense in that—and not at all of what
might happen. I am not starring myself for any of this;
but I am not blaming myself. I couldn’t help it any
more than I could help it if a boat capsized and chucked
me into rapids that I hadn’t strength to swim.</p>

<p>The first inkling of my intelligence returned when I
heard Irene croak something about Uncle Thaddeus.
I turned to look at Grandfather, just in time to see him
loosen his hold on the foot of the bed and slip down into
a heap on the floor.</p>

<p>Again, don’t be frightened. Grandfather is all right
now—or, at least, as nearly all right as he could be
after having had a second shock of the sort. He won’t
stay in bed; and he is declaring that it was all nonsense
for us to have sent for Dr. Joe. Just the same, I’ll be
glad to see Dr. Joe put in an appearance here. He’s
antiseptic, that’s what he is. I wish to the Lord he had
been here during the fracas yesterday evening.</p>

<p>I am not needing to tell you what seeing Grandfather
go under did to us. Even Dong Lee, who had come up
with the others, went clear balmy—pushing us away
from Grandfather, or trying to, and chattering. Olympe
revived, and contributed more than her share to the
bedlam. I’ll not attempt to describe it; I couldn’t,
anyway. But when I tell you that, after we’d got
Grandfather to the sofa he lay there, looking as if he were
dead, and that we could not get his heartbeats, and
thought that he was dead, or dying, you will understand
why we were not attending to anyone or anything
else. You’ll understand why, until Grandfather’s
ruddiness began to seep back into his cheeks, and his eyes
were opened and he was talking to us, reassuring us, we
did not give a damn if a whole regiment of murderers
were marching, slowly, away from the house. They’d had
time to, right enough. It was half-past seven before
Chris began his declamation about this being the same
thing over again, and his rhetorical questions about
what were we doing, and where was the murderer, and
so forth—all pyrotechnical rather than practical.</p>

<p>Grandfather, by this time, was sitting up on the
sofa with one arm around Lucy and one around Aunt
Gracia, both of whom, unromantically, were
hiccoughing convulsively. As I looked at them, I had a
bright idea. They—all of us—needed police protection.</p>

<p>I stated this idea, and, also, that I was going right
then to ride to Quilterville and get Gus Wildoch and a
deputy or two. I started off on the run. Grandfather
called to me.</p>

<p>“My boy,” he said, when I had come back into
Olympe’s room, “you said that you were going to tell
the sheriff what had happened here. Do you know what
has happened here? Does anyone know? I do not.”</p>

<p>If I looked as I felt, I looked like two fools.</p>

<p>“We heard a revolver shot,” Grandfather said. “We
came to this room and found that Olympe had, again,
fainted. The similarity of this circumstance with that of
tragedy proved too much for my strength, I am ashamed
to say. Olympe, my dear, did you happen to discharge
a revolver by mistake?”</p>

<p>Olympe pulled herself up higher on her pillows, drew
her pretty old-rose wrapper about her shoulders, perked
up her famous chin, and made it known to all present
that she had never yet fired a revolver on any account,
either by mistake or purposely, and that, she trusted
she never should. In the midst of death, as it were,
Olympe is a gentlewoman. She had just passed through
a most terrible experience, and still she found space to
resent with dignity what she considered an implication
of rowdyism from Grandfather.</p>

<p>Grandfather apologized, and asked her if she had any
memory at all of anything that had happened before she
had fainted.</p>

<p>I believe that we all thought she wouldn’t have.
Thank the Lord she did have! It took her a long time to
tell it, but what she told was this:</p>

<p>Right after I left her she had got out of bed and
locked her door. She had gone immediately back to
bed. She was lying there, annoyed because she had
forgotten to take her drops while she had been up. She
reached for her wrapper, on the foot of her bed, preparatory
to rising again, and, just as she did so, she heard a
noise at the cupola window—the one I had purposely
left open from the top. She turned, and looked across
the room toward it. She saw a man, wearing a bright
red mask, slowly pushing open her window. She tried
to scream, but her throat had closed. She tried to move.
She could not. She said that the sensation was precisely
the same as one experiences during nightmares. She
closed her eyes. She made an effort for prayer. She felt
that she was suffocating. She could hear the window
being raised slowly, inch by inch. Something, she said,
seemed to break in her mind. She thought, “This is
what death means.” That was the last thing she knew
until she opened her eyes and saw us all gathered
around Grandfather on the sofa. She thought that the
man in the red mask had come into her room and
killed Grandfather.</p>

<p>That was all she could tell us. She had not heard the
shot fired. It was enough to tell Gus. A man, wearing a
red mask, had climbed to the porch roof and into
Olympe’s room, through her window. He had fired one
shot, and had escaped.</p>

<p>I asked Grandfather if I might go, now, to
Quilterville. He said for me to use my own judgment.</p>

<p>Here’s a hot one on me, Judy. While I was saddling
Tuesday’s Child, I had a queer feeling, which I did not
entirely recognize. About a quarter of a mile down the
road, it introduced itself to me. I was scared. Rather
definitely scared, and this time for my own skin. The
moon was not up, yet, and there were enough clouds to
keep the starlight from being showy. I took the short cut
through the oaks, and every falling leaf or creaking
branch was the guy in the red mask taking aim at me.
Out in the open again, he bounded ahead of me like a
pebble skipped over water. And once, disguised as a ball
of tumbleweed, he rose up and slew me. For the first
time it occurred to me that something more potent
than Irene’s yelping might have kept Chris from starting
off, alone, to Quilterville the night Father was
killed.</p>

<p>My fear wasn’t based on altogether faulty reasoning.
The man had forty minutes’ head start on me. If he
needed a better start than that, and didn’t want the
county people on his trail for a while, the smartest
thing he could have done would have been to pop
me off on the way. Number Twenty-six, eastbound,
goes through Quilterville at three o’clock in the
morning. If he had been planning to catch it, he wouldn’t
have wanted any advance notices. Evidently, though,
he had not made any such plans (I think we have
given him too much credit for smart planning),
because I got into town sound in wind and limb.</p>

<p>Gus Wildoch had gone to bed; and, since he’d had a
few drinks too many before he had got there, he was
rather nasty. Seemed to think that Q 2 was entirely too
troublesome. Also, he appeared to be annoyed because
Olympe had not been killed, and unable to discover why
I had wakened him for any other reason. When he
further discovered that, so far as I knew, we had not
been robbed, he washed his hands of the whole
circumstance until morning.</p>

<p>I rode over to Al Raddy’s and got him to come down
and open up the station so that I could send a telegram
to Dr. Joe. Then I borrowed Al’s gun and rode home
again. I was well over my scare by the time I’d got back
to the ranch, but I can’t say the same for Chris.</p>

<p>He indulged in one of his beautiful tempers when he
let me in through the front door and saw that I had
come alone. We had a sweet passage, in which he said
my failure to bring help was about what he might have
expected from me. I made some would-be clever retorts,
and was getting pretty hot, when I saw that Chris
was using his rage to cover his fright. I came off my
perch and asked him whether they had made any
alarming discoveries while I had been gone. His reply
was worthy of Olympe.</p>

<p>“Alarming enough,” Chris said, “to make us certain
that no one’s life is safe on this place until we find the
man who is, apparently, bent on destroying the Quilter
family.”</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>After I had left the ranch to go to Quilterville,
Grandfather, Chris, and Aunt Gracia had made
another thorough investigation of the house.</p>

<p>The bedroom doors were all locked again on the outside,
as they had been locked on the night that Father
was killed. Again, too, the same doors had been left
unlocked—that is, the attic and the bathroom doors.
Father’s door, this time, had been locked, and Olympe’s
locked door had been unlocked and left open. (That
door unlocked would seem to indicate that the fellow
had rushed out of it into the hall. But, there is this: the
instant we heard the shot, all of us, except Irene and
Chris who came up the front stairway, ran straight up
the back stairway and into the upper hall. Would he
have run out to meet us? Olympe’s door is at the far
end of the hall from the attic door.) The seven keys were
on Olympe’s bedside table, as they had been on Father’s
bedside table.</p>

<p>The rope, the same old clothes-line, which had been
returned to the attic, was on the floor in Olympe’s room.
It was not tied around the leg of the bed, nor around
anything. It was lying there, in a loose coil, near the foot
of the bed.</p>

<p>The bullet from the gun had gone into the wall,
about three feet above Olympe’s pillows. Evidently,
he had aimed at her; but his shot had gone wild.</p>

<p>Nothing was out of place in Olympe’s room. Exactly
as it had been in Father’s room—not a chair seemed
to have been moved, not a drawer opened.</p>

<p>Lying on the floor, directly beneath the open cupola
window, was a mask, large enough to cover a man’s
entire face, cut roughly out of bright red satin. So, in
spite of my surety, it would seem, now, that undoubtedly
“red mask” were the words that Father had said
to Irene before he died.</p>

<p>Now, to see what we can do with all this. First, the
locked doors: There could be, has been, endless speculation
about those locked doors. But, finally, they seem
to come to but two hypotheses. Either the fellow is up
to something of which, as yet, not one of us has begun
to get an inkling; or else he is a raving maniac, and
his very lack of purpose is what is throwing us all so
completely off the scent, and also what is saving him.</p>

<p>I am strong for the second theory—that this is the
work of a maniac. A smart man might have locked us
all in our rooms that first night. No man, in his senses,
would have run the risk of being out in the hall long
enough to lock all the doors of the vacant rooms last
evening. He had had to collect the keys from the inside
of the doors again, and he had had to do it after he had
come into Olympe’s room through the window. If he
knew anything, he must have known that no one was in
any of those rooms he so carefully locked. But he
repeated, exactly, his first performance; even to leaving
the bathroom and attic doors unlocked, and the door of
his victim’s room standing open.</p>

<p>From first to last, that rope business has seemed the
work of a lunatic. This final move of lugging the thing
into Olympe’s room, and leaving it there, unattached to
anything, is the crowning lunacy.</p>

<p>It doesn’t take a maniac, I suppose, to miss his aim.
But firing as high as three feet above his mark, when
Olympe was lying there unconscious and motionless,
seems rather wild for sanity.</p>

<p>Nothing being disturbed in either room appears to
establish the fact that the fellow’s one motive is
cold-blooded murder. As Aunt Gracia said at the inquest, we
could grant that Father might have had an enemy.
But unless we decide that this man has made up his
mind to wipe out the entire Quilter family, which, of
course, could be the decision of only a maniac, we
cannot conceive of Olympe’s having the same enemy—or
any enemy, for that matter.</p>

<p>The mask is made of bright red satin. It is about
twelve inches long and ten inches wide. It has two small
holes cut for the eyes. It has strings, cut from the same
satin, knotted into the sides. The strings were tied
together in the back, as they had been when he was wearing
it. He must then have pulled it off over his head and
dropped it, by mistake we assume, just before he got out
of the window.</p>

<p>With the exception of Chris, we all believe, I think,
that he did get out of the window this time. It was a
darn risky business, running along that sloping roof to
the rain spout, and getting hold of the spout, under the
eaves, on a night as dark as last night was. I shouldn’t
care to try it in the daytime. But this guy must be
something of a circus performer, because he not only
had to get off the roof, but he had also to get on it by
means of the rain spout. Chris and I have gone carefully
over the porch possibilities. The spout seems to
be the one thing he could have used to climb on. The
old trellis, at the south end, has completely rotted and
fallen to pieces.</p>

<p>Perhaps here I would better give another line or two
about the search that Grandfather, Aunt Gracia, and
Chris made of the house. They went about it
systematically. They did not forget the roof this time. The
three outside doors were all locked on the inside, as is
usual now. Every window downstairs was locked on
the inside. The cellar doors were locked. Chris and I
made another thorough search of the place after I got
home last night. No one could have been hiding in the
house.</p>

<p>This is what Chris thinks queers my maniac contention:
He insists that it would take a keen mind to do
exactly the same thing, twice, and outwit us each time.
Of course, any fool who was willing to risk his neck
could have made a clean getaway last night. After
the snow melted, we had another freeze, and the ground
is so hard that we can’t stamp our own footprints
down into it. Escape, then, last night—discounting
again the distance from the porch roof to the ground,
and the dangers of the rain spout as a ladder—would
have been simple enough. We know, though, that he
did not get away across the roof that first night. We
know that the snow was unmarked by any sort of print.
Consequently, Chris thinks that the fellow worked
again last night whatever foxy scheme he worked the
first time. That is so reasonable that I am more than
half ashamed of myself for not agreeing. The rope, the
locked doors, and the red mask prove, surely, that it was
the same man both times.</p>

<p>The others are beginning to wonder, now, if we might
have been mistaken about footprints that first night; if
we might have overlooked a single line of them. Lucy,
with her ingenious mind, has suggested that he might
have got away on stilts! I know that there were no
footprints. We have to stick to what we do know, or we shall
never get anywhere. Since the man did not get out of
the house that Monday night, he must have stayed in
the house. Until last night, I have been certain that,
since he did not stay in hiding in the house he stayed,
as Aunt Gracia said, not in hiding. Or, to put it brashly,
he was one of us.</p>

<p>Last night every single one of us was in the dining
room, sitting around the table. Dong Lee was serving
us. That settles it. It could not have been one of us.
Consequently, he did stay in hiding in the house.</p>

<p>All this seems to grant him super-brains and sanity.
But I believe it is quite as reasonable to grant him a
madman’s cunning and a fool’s luck. When we find out
what he did, where he went that first night, I’ll bet ten
acres of Q 2 that we’ll not find any deep scheming, any
genius job at the bottom of it. I’ll bet the same ten
acres that we’ll find something so simple that a child
might have devised it, so transparent that we’ve all
looked straight through it without seeing it. I feel,
somehow, certain that the entire thing is right before
us for us to look at—if only we knew how to look.
How to look seems to be the question now rather than
where to look. You know what a wizard Aunt Gracia is
when it comes to finding lost articles; and how she
always says it is because she never hunts, but always
thinks. It is thinking, now, and not peering under beds
or into apple bins, that is going to land us where we
need to be. In spite of my smartness, I have been trying
to do some thinking that includes the trapdoor in the
attic; but I haven’t had a sensible result, as yet.</p>

<p>Both times we have given the fellow a good many
minutes to use as he pleased. But, since we are more or
less civilized beings, not entirely inured to tragedy, I
suppose it is not wholly to our discredit that our first
impulses, on occasions of this sort, should be for
something other than an immediate pursuit of the criminal.</p>

<p>Gus and his brothers do not subscribe to such
sentimentality. They arrived, fully panoplied, about nine
this morning and were at once overcome with disgust to
think we had given attention to Olympe and Grandfather
last night before we had started hue and cry.
Nor did Chris’s contention that he had gone straight to
the window in Olympe’s room, last night, and looked
out of it, and seen nothing (the man could have got to
the cover of the lower porch by that time), help much.</p>

<p>“Sure, I know,” Gus said. “Looking out of windows
is all right. But how long did you folks hang around
and talk things over this time, before you men thought
of going out after the —— —— who did the killing?”</p>

<p>Later, he relented to the extent of admitting that,
since he represented law and order in Quilter County,
he supposed he’d try to do what he could. He added,
however, that considering all the circumstances, and
the time that had elapsed, he didn’t think we had a
right to expect him to do much.</p>

<p>Aunt Gracia suggested that she thought he should
depute at least two men to guard our house for a time.</p>

<p>Gus said, “Would you want them deputies to stay
inside the house or outside the house, Miss Quilter?”</p>

<p>Whether or not he was trying to be funny, I don’t
know. I don’t much care. It is relief, I guess. Now,
since we all know that not one of us could have had a
hand in this, it doesn’t seem to matter, greatly, what
other people think.</p>

<p>The Wildochs had a talk with all of us—Grandfather
was the spokesman, of course—first thing. Then they
milled about the place for an hour or two, and made a
great show of examining Olympe’s room. She is still in
bed, so we curbed their enthusiasms for detail as much
as we could; postponing, for instance, the minutia of
digging the bullet out of the wall. When they finally left,
Gus said that he would see what he could do about sending
a couple of the boys out for a few days. No one has
come, as yet, so he must have seen that he could do
nothing.</p>

<p>Don’t, for the Lord’s sake, Judy, go worrying about
our safety. Unlike Gus, we are able to do several things.
Chris and I are both staying up to-night, for all night.
The happy practice of feeding Whatof and Keeper in
the kitchen shed has been discontinued. The house is
locked from cellar to attic. We are getting our fresh air
from the fireplace flues, and our strength is as—and so
forth. No kidding, it makes a difference.</p>

<p>I guess this tells it all for to-night. Except sorry, and
so on, for that fool letter I wrote to you yesterday. And,
Judy, don’t forget about sending for Lucy, pronto. If
we do get the money from Father’s insurance, I am
going to try to think of some scheme for getting
Grandfather away for at least a few weeks. Lucy and
Grandfather are the only ones here whom I am worried much
about. The others seem to be coming through pretty
well. Olympe, I am sure, will be all right as soon as Uncle
Phineas gets home. Thank fortune, when he comes this
time, he’ll be able to stay.</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="dateline">Thursday, October 18, 1900.</p>

<p><span class="sal">Dear Judy:</span>
You are a good kid, all right, but
someway or other your letters seem to rub me the
wrong way. For gosh sakes, Jude, stop telling me that I
didn’t murder Father. If you keep on with that line, I’ll
think, as I thought for a while about Chris and Irene,
that you are protesting too much. After all, you can’t
<em>know</em> that I didn’t do it, as you keep declaring with
underlines. Nobody here <em>knows</em>—anything. How can you
know, away off there in Colorado?</p>

<p>It serves me right enough, for beginning this crazy,
underhanded business of writing to you. The nights
were long, and I had to have something to do, I guess,
and the letters gave me a good excuse for writing, as
Olympe says, “at a time like this.” Funny, how we’ll
find excuses for ourselves. Funnier, how we’ll believe
what we desire to believe. I don’t know what right I
have to the plural. No matter; don’t stop, too long, to
laugh over the humour I have just presented. I have
something much more amusing to give to you.</p>

<p>Olympe had supposed that Uncle Phineas would
come with Dr. Joe from Portland this afternoon.
(Dr. Joe had been out of town and hadn’t got my
telegram until late Wednesday.) When Uncle Phineas
did not come, her fury propelled her from her bed and
downstairs in her black gown—by this time fully
denuded of its festive colour.</p>

<p>At seven this evening, Lucy came to me and asked me
to come upstairs with her. She led me directly to
Olympe’s room. Lucy is so choice, that I am going to
attempt to quote her, as nearly as I can.</p>

<p>“Neal,” said she, “I have something to tell to someone,
and I have decided that, just now, you are
probably the best one of the family to tell.”</p>

<p>Said I: “To tell what?”</p>

<p>Said Lucy: “To tell that I am very sure no man with
a red mask came to Olympe’s room on Tuesday night.
Ever since I decided to be an author, Grandfather has
been training me to observe closely. Now, Neal dear,
will you please observe with me?”</p>

<p>She asked me to lie down on Olympe’s bed, where
Olympe had been lying on Tuesday night. She had the
night lamp lighted and on the table as it had been that
night. She crossed the room, stood in front of the
window, and asked me whether I could see her white face.</p>

<p>I could not. The night lamp, shaded as it is, lights a
small circle on the bedside table, and lights nothing else.</p>

<p>I heard her open the window. “I am sitting in the
window now,” she said, “with the pane pulled down
between you and me. Does the glass make a difference?
Can you see my white face?”</p>

<p>I could not.</p>

<p>“Then how,” she asked, “could Olympe have seen a
man, and the bright red mask, at this same time on
Tuesday night? Now listen,” she went on. “When I
bang the window up hard, like this, you can hear it?
But can you hear it when I raise it slowly, like this, inch
by inch?”</p>

<p>Since it made no sound whatever, I could not.</p>

<p>“You see,” Lucy stated, “Olympe said that the window
being raised, slowly, inch by inch, was what she
heard to make her look toward it. She kept on hearing
it, raised inch by inch. I can’t hear it myself, when I’m
raising it slowly. You can’t hear it, over there. Olympe
is, really, a trifle deaf.”</p>

<p>Neal shines. Neal is brilliant. “Just the same, Lucy,
we all of us heard the shot. There is no arguing away
from that.”</p>

<p>Lucy grows maternal. “Yes, Neal darling, of course.
But, you know, I think that Olympe fired the shot
herself. You see, she always slept with Uncle Phineas’s
gun under her pillow when he was away from home. She
kept it unloaded—or meant to. But the cartridges for it
are right here in the commode drawer, where you found
them the other night. Olympe could have put just one
of them into the gun, and got into bed, and shot it off
up there into the wall, where she knew it would stick
and not hurt anyone. Then she could have jabbed it
back under her pillow, and plumped right down into bed
again. If we had searched for a gun, this time, and we
didn’t, none of us would have thought it odd if we’d
found the unloaded one under her pillow where she
always kept it.”</p>

<p>“At least not as odd,” I said, “as I think it is for you
to accuse Olympe of this. Why are you doing it, Lucy?”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you my purpose in a minute or two,” Lucy
said. “First, I should like to get through with my
thinking. I think that Olympe’s reason for planning to do
this was that Uncle Phineas went away and left her
alone, when she kept telling him she needed his protection.
Uncle Phineas, of course, will be shocked and
remorseful when he finds how nearly Olympe did come to
being killed. And, too, you know, Neal, Olympe has
been sort of left out of things since Father was killed.
Being almost killed herself, gives her an entrée. We
know that is the way Olympe is made, and that she
can’t help it at all—not any more than she can help
being rather dull.</p>

<p>“The mask was cut from one of Olympe’s old ball
gowns that I used to dress up in, in the attic. The
trouble is, some little snips of it were here in her work
basket, and some threads of it were still caught in her
dull scissors. I thought it wise to look, because Sherlock
Holmes was always making such important discoveries
with bits of tweed, you know. Now, I think, I can tell
you my purpose. I want you to explain to Olympe,
Neal. She must be explained to, and I think it would be
much better taste for you to do the explaining than
for me, at my age, to attempt it.”</p>

<p>“Explain—what, Lucy?” I was shocked at the way I
croaked it.</p>

<p>“But, Neal! You must explain to her that the man
jumped quite heavily into the room from the window.
That he came gliding across the floor, and stooped to
glare, or peer, or some such thing, at her, beneath the
lamp. That she took one horror-stricken glance at the
frightful eyes, burning through the holes in the red
mask, and, as he made a cruel, menacing sound, and
seemed to reach for his gun, she fainted dead away. I
have cleaned all the scraps out of her work basket, of
course.</p>

<p>“You must be very careful, darling. It will be difficult.
But it is necessary, now that Olympe has left her room,
that she should not tell that story of hers outside the
family circle. She had planned it so nicely, she thought,
to have it all exactly like the other time. She even stole
out in the hall, after you had left her, and locked all the
doors. I think she must have brought the rope from the
attic in the afternoon, and hidden it in Father’s room.
Then she had only to dash in there, and carry it into her
room. She must have hurried to get things all arranged
and play the whole scene in so short a time. Poor
Olympe—it must be sad for anyone to have to be as
important to herself as Olympe is. You do understand,
don’t you, Neal, that being an actress is really an
affliction of Olympe’s, like Panys Gummer’s short leg?”</p>

<p>I told Lucy I understood that. What I did not understand,
I went on to say, was how a little girl, who could
think through a thing as intricate as this could possibly
have been frightened by a silly story about Archie
Biggil hiding in locked trunks.</p>

<p>Lucy said: “I only pretended to believe in that story.
I thought if you could possibly think that I was afraid of
Archie Biggil it would be so much better than for you
to know the truth. Neal, dear, you have seemed to need
comfort of late.”</p>

<p>I asked her if she would please consider that I had
been comforted, and tell me, if she knew, what she had
been afraid of.</p>

<p>“Why, Neal,” she said, “I was afraid of Olympe, of
course.”</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>She left me wordless. I must have looked my need for
comfort, however, for Lucy hastened with it.</p>

<p>“Darling,” she said, “that was my mere physical
fear. It wasn’t by any means as uncomfortable as my
unphysical fear that outsiders might discover the truth;
but it made me more of a baby. I was especially afraid
after I had laughed at Olympe, that evening. But, of
course, I have had to be a little afraid from the first.
And the Archie Biggil story made it worse. When
Olympe told me that, I knew. Even Olympe, you see,
Neal, couldn’t have credited that Archie Biggil story.”</p>

<p>“Lucy,” I managed to question, “are you saying
that you believe Olympe murdered Father?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she answered, in that direct way of hers,
“that is what I believe. I am sure, of course, that
Olympe didn’t mean to do it. I think she went into
Father’s room with Uncle Phineas’s gun that night, and
that she thought the gun was unloaded. When she got
into Father’s room, she acted one of her scenes for him.
I think she must have been trying to make him promise
that he would not consent to Christopher’s selling the
ranch. Christopher might not have sold if Father had
opposed it strongly enough. Olympe was worried about
the poorhouse, you know. So I think she went to Father
to play like she was very, very brave—probably she had
Charlotte Corday in mind, or some other fearless lady.
Yes, Neal, I know it is very silly. But, you see, Olympe
lives in this very silly world that she makes for
herself—I mean, really lives in it all the time.</p>

<p>“I fancy, when she took the revolver from her dress,
that Father just lay there and laughed at her. You
know what laughing does to Olympe. You saw her the
other night, when I laughed. And so, quite carried away
with her acting, as she does get, you know, she pulled
the trigger of the gun. She never thought that it
would—but it did—go off. She must have been dreadfully
shocked and frightened. She ran straightway back to her
room, and fainted.</p>

<p>“Of course, she’d have had to be a little crazy ever to
have begun any of that—or to think she could point a
revolver at Father and get a promise. And I thought
such a horrible accident might have made her a little
more crazy. And I thought—I’m afraid this is not clear
thinking, though—that suppose she’d suspect I had
guessed the truth. And I know, Neal, this was silly of
me; but I couldn’t keep from being afraid she might
play another scene, and have another accident.”</p>

<p>Why, I asked, if Olympe had had no idea of using her
gun, if she had thought that it was unloaded, had she
locked us all in our rooms before she had gone into
Father’s room?</p>

<p>“I think,” Lucy answered, “that she didn’t. I think
that, when Irene came upstairs and found Christopher
had locked her out, it vexed her so much that she slipped
along the hall and locked all the doors—just to make
trouble in the morning. You know, she told me herself
that she locked the stairway doors to show Christopher
that two could play at that lock-out game.”</p>

<p>“Do you think, Lucy, that Irene could have opened
all of our doors, removed the keys, and locked us in
without our hearing her?”</p>

<p>“I think she could have with all of us but Grandfather.
If Grandfather had heard someone fumbling at
his door, he would have supposed it was some one of the
family, and, while he might have called a question, he
might not have. If he had thought some one of us was
trying to do something or other to his door without
disturbing him, it would be just like Grandfather to be
too courteous to let us know he had been disturbed.”</p>

<p>“And you believe that Grandfather would lie about
it, afterwards?”</p>

<p>“That is wrong of you, Neal. But I do think that
Grandfather might be generous rather than just. Since
he didn’t know that it was Irene who took his key, he
might think it more generous not to say that he
suspected her. Since Grandfather would die, as you know,
to save the Quilter honour, surely he would keep silent
to save it.”</p>

<p>“All right. How did the keys get into Father’s room?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps Irene had them with her, in her wrapper
pocket, when she came back upstairs after she heard the
shot.”</p>

<p>“And why did she, from the very start, lie about
locking the doors?”</p>

<p>“I thought,” Lucy said, “that she didn’t like to
confess she had been the one to lock us all in. Everyone
seemed to think that whoever had locked us in had
committed the murder.”</p>

<p>“All right. Can you answer this? When Irene locked
us all in our rooms, wouldn’t she have locked Olympe in
her room, too?”</p>

<p>“She might have locked Olympe in Father’s room.”</p>

<p>“Only,” I protested, “when Irene opened Father’s
door to get his key, wouldn’t Olympe and Father both
have seen her?”</p>

<p>“If Father’s key had not been in the keyhole,” Lucy
answered, “Irene might have heard voices in his room,
and not have opened the door. She might have locked it
with one of the keys she already had.”</p>

<p>“Very well. You have locked Father’s door. How did
Olympe get out of it, after the shooting, and into her
own locked room again?”</p>

<p>“If Father’s key had been in some handy place, she
might have used it to unlock the door, and to open her
own door, and to lock her own door after her, again. Or,
Olympe, when she went into Father’s room, might have
turned the key in the lock. It would have made a
gesture, and a speech. She might have held the key in her
hand, and have shown it to Father, and told him that,
until she had his promise, neither of them could leave
that room. Irene’s locking was just naughtiness. If
Father’s door had been locked on the inside, she
wouldn’t have bothered about it. She’d have locked the
others and gone on downstairs.”</p>

<p>“And the rope, hanging out of the open window?”</p>

<p>Judy, on the square, I fully expected the kid to have
some logical, well-thought-out explanation of the rope.
I have spared you a description of my own mental
processes during this interview with our little
twelve-year-old sister. I have assumed that your imagination
would be more competent than my powers of description.
Well, thank the Lord, the baby stuck at the
rope.</p>

<p>“Could it be,” she questioned, “that Olympe had
threatened to hang herself out of the window with the
rope?”</p>

<p>“Or to hang Father?” I suggested.</p>

<p>“I know,” she agreed, and blushed, “that is bad.
That is allowing my literary imagination to run away
with my logic. No, Neal, I can’t explain the rope.
There is a chance that Father had wanted to get someone
into the house that night, and had fixed it to help
him in. Grandfather has told me about other incidents,
that life allows such coincidences—I mean as
Father having fixed the rope on the same night that he
was shot by accident—but that literature does not.
This is life—so that might be. Or it might be that
Father had lowered something out of the window that
night; something heavy that would have pulled the bed
a bit. If he had done so before the snow was on the
ground, whoever was below to receive it could have
taken it and walked right away, or wheeled it in a
barrow, and the snow would have covered any
footprints or barrow tracks.”</p>

<p>“And Father, who had gone to all that trouble for
secrecy, would have lowered his treasure chest out of
the window, and have gone back to bed, leaving the
window wide open for the wind to blow over him, and
the rope dangling to be seen?”</p>

<p>Lucy argued: “The rope couldn’t have been seen
until morning. Father might have had some reason for
leaving it as it was for a few hours. Perhaps someone was
going to send something up again—and couldn’t when
he realized that the snow would show the footprints
in the morning. Father would have closed the window.
But Olympe might have opened it, at the last minute.
She might have thought she’d throw the gun out of it.
And then, when she saw the snow, and realized how a
black gun would show in the white snow, changed her
mind.”</p>

<p>“By the way, Lucy, why did Father say ‘red mask’ to
Irene?”</p>

<p>“If he did say it, I think he said it to save Olympe.
He’d wish to, you know. He’d have been sure that
Olympe did not mean to shoot him.”</p>

<p>“Have you decided what heavy thing it was that
Father lowered out of the window, and to whom he
lowered it?”</p>

<p>“I had thought,” Lucy answered, “that you might
know that. I had thought it might have something to do
with the secret you and Uncle Phineas have been
keeping together. I thought Uncle Phineas, since no one
knew where he was the night Father was killed, might
have been under Father’s window.”</p>

<p>As it happens, Judy, that is utter idiocy. Ruled out.
A good many persons know exactly where Uncle
Phineas was that night. We shall all know it, before long
now. I told Lucy this. She remarked that she was glad.</p>

<p>I told her, next, that this mistake of hers should be a
lesson to her concerning how easily mistakes could be
made in matters of this sort. (That sounds like me and
my heavy platitudinous, pedagogic style. Odd, the
continuation of Lucy’s devotion.)</p>

<p>She asked me what other mistakes she had made.</p>

<p>I explained to her that, though she had worked her
problem neatly, she had not got the right answer
because she had left out an important equation—the
human equation. I asked her, if Olympe had actually
planned to go through with such a scene in Father’s
room, what her first thought would have been.</p>

<p>“To dress up for the part,” said Lucy. “But I decided
that she had undressed, again, before we found
her in her outing-flannel nightgown.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” I said. “But examine this. Would
Olympe leave Father, mortally wounded, run to her
room, get out of her costume, hang it in the closet—it
was not strewn about her room—put on her nightgown,
take the gun again into her hand, and fall in a dead faint
on the floor? Not only would she have done all that, but
also could she have done all that before she fainted?”</p>

<p>“I should think,” said Lucy, “since she did miss
meeting Irene in the hall, there’d have been plenty of
time, after that.”</p>

<p>“Narrow it down,” I insisted. “Would Olympe, if
she had shot Father by mistake, have left him alone to
suffer and die? Remember, Lucy, that in spite of her
artificiality, Olympe is a good woman.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean,” Lucy gasped, “that Olympe shot
Father on purpose?”</p>

<p>“I mean,” I said, “you little nonny, you, that
Olympe did not shoot Father at all. I mean, that it
has been wrong of you to think these thoughts.”</p>

<p>“Doubtless,” she sighed, in that seldom-used, grown-up
manner of hers. “But I have decided that I must
have a wicked personality. I have broken all the rules
of conduct Grandfather gave to me. But at least,
Neal, I am logical.”</p>

<p>I told her that if deciding one of the family was a
murderer, or, at best, a brutal beast of a coward, and
that all the rest of the family were scamps and liars was
an evidence of logic, she was logical right enough.</p>

<p>“Whom have I accused of lying?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Begin with Chris. He said, under oath, that he did
not lock Irene out of their room that night.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t hear him say it. But, even so, I’d call that a
very light lie—a lie that any gentleman should be willing
to use to get a lady out of serious trouble, especially
since the lady was his wife.”</p>

<p>“And what serious trouble was Irene in?”</p>

<p>“But, Neal, she was the only one of the family who
was locked out in the hall.”</p>

<p>“Lucy,” I questioned, “whom have you been talking
to?”</p>

<p>“Really, only to myself,” she said. “But I’ve
pretended to be talking to Sherlock Holmes. I have been
Dr. Watson for days now—whenever I have felt at all
up to it. It is an excellent way to clear one’s mind, Neal.
Why don’t you try it, dear?”</p>

<p>I told her that I didn’t care for the sort of clear brain
that could clean out a good woman’s character in a
swoop and leave a bad woman, a woman rotten to the
core. I asked her if the second affair had not come up,
how long she had planned to keep this mad belief of
hers, that Olympe had done the murder, a secret?</p>

<p>“I had meant,” she replied, “to keep it forever. It
seemed best. You’d think, Neal, that keeping it would
have been quite easy. No. It hasn’t been.”</p>

<p>You’ll hate me for this, Judy, I suppose. It was
beastly of me, I know. But I’d thought that Lucy
needed a lesson. And—why not be honest?—I love the
working of the kid’s mind. I am as proud as a parent
when I get a peek at the way it goes. But that final
little, “No. It hasn’t been,” of hers, got the best
of me.</p>

<p>I told her then what I should have told her in the
beginning, and what she had had no opportunity to know
without being told, since she was not at the inquest:
That the bullet, which Dr. Joe had removed from
Father’s body, had been fired from a .38 Colt’s of fairly
recent make. That Uncle Phineas’s old Colt’s was a
.32 calibre. That he left it at home, now, when he went
on prospecting trips, because he had the new .38 that he
bought a couple of years ago when Father and Grandfather
bought theirs of that man who came around on a
bicycle taking orders for them.</p>

<p>“Was the kind he sold the kind that killed darling
Father?” Lucy questioned.</p>

<p>“Yes. And every man who has a gun in three counties
has one of them. We can’t get far with that; but far
enough to prove that a .38 bullet cannot be fired from a
.32 gun.”</p>

<p>“I had thought,” Lucy said, “that Uncle Phineas
went to the city. You and I telegraphed there.”</p>

<p>I told her that before long now she’d know where
Uncle Phineas had been; and, until she did know, it
would be more polite to stop guessing about it.</p>

<p>“I only meant,” she explained, “that, if Uncle
Phineas had gone to Portland, and not prospecting, he
probably wouldn’t have taken his new .38 Colt’s with
him.”</p>

<p>For a wonder, I understood what she meant. It
proves again, plainly, my contention that guns, ropes,
coal oil, and their ilk are worthless, worse than worthless,
when it comes to finding the truth in a case of this
sort.</p>

<p>“Very well, Lucy,” I said. “If you can believe,
after having known Olympe all your life, that she would
run away from Father, whom she really loved, when he
was lying there with blood streaming from his breast,
dying—run away, hide a gun so that it could never be
found, get out of her clothes, and the rest of it, with no
thought of anything but saving herself—it wouldn’t
help you much to tell you that Uncle Phineas did have
his gun with him, his .38 Colt’s, on that trip. I took it
out of his valise myself, when I helped him to unpack.”</p>

<p>Lucy looked at me, drew in a long breath, and burst
into tears. For a moment I thought they were tears of
relief. Not so.</p>

<p>“It was so much better,” she sobbed, “to think that
Olympe did it by accident. None of the rest of us could
have done it by accident. And, besides, nothing is real
to Olympe. Neal—Neal—— See, now—the rest of us!”</p>

<p>She said it, Judy. The rest of us. The more I think of
it, the more I am certain that Lucy is right, absolutely
right, about Olympe’s little drama of Tuesday evening.
It is all perfectly evident. But I do not believe that
Olympe staged it either to spite Uncle Phineas or to get
the centre of the stage. I know that she is too good a
woman to have yielded to the temptation for no better
reasons than these. I think that she thought the act
would do just what it did do, for me at least. That it
would remove suspicion from every member of our
household.</p>

<p>Damn it all, Jude! Why didn’t I think of something of
the sort? Why didn’t any other one of us? Do you get
the irony of it? Olympe, the one person here on the
ranch—I suppose we should have to except Irene,
also—who would have bungled it hopelessly was the one
person who thought of the scheme. If Chris, or Aunt
Gracia, or I had possessed wits for the conception, we’d
have had wits for carrying it through convincingly.</p>

<p>I don’t know whether or not I have been the one fool
of the household. If any of the others have doubted
Olympe’s story, they have not betrayed their doubt by
the flicker of an eyelash. Though, of course, Grandfather
doubted it from the beginning. His first question,
I am sure I told you, was whether Olympe had discharged
a revolver by accident. That, too, explains his
reluctance to having me ride immediately to Quilterville.
Also, when the county bunch arrived, Grandfather
had them come directly to his room. He said that
Olympe was in no condition to be troubled with questions.
You see, he wished to tell Olympe’s story for her.
And when I heard him telling it, “Mrs. Quilter was
aroused from her sleep, on Tuesday evening, by hearing
a noise in her room. She opened her eyes and saw a
man creeping toward her; a man whose face appeared
to be covered with the red mask we have since found.
She fainted from terror——” I merely thought that he
had been too much fuddled at the time to get Olympe’s
story entirely as to detail.</p>

<p>It seems to me, now, that Chris did flash an odd glance
while Grandfather was telling Olympe’s story. If I am
right about that, it might easily mean that Chris
thought as I thought concerning Grandfather’s
befuddlement. Because I have dreaded it, I suppose, I
have imagined, once or twice, that Grandfather was
getting less keen here of late. He is not. This proves it.
Or, if he is, he could lose about half of his intelligence
and still give us all cards and spades.</p>

<p>This, then, Judy, so far as I am concerned, is the end
of it. We are back where we began, the night of Father’s
murder. I am through. I am not writing any more of
these Mr. Micawber epistles. I don’t know who the
murderer is. I don’t want to know. You don’t know. I

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="dateline">Saturday, October 20, 1900.</p>

<p><span class="sal">Dear Judy:</span>
I have what two weeks ago would
have been mighty good news for you and for
us all. Uncle Phineas got home this afternoon with
$45,000 marked in his bank book. That is, you
understand, he had deposited a check for $45,000 in the
Portland bank.</p>

<p>When he went prospecting down into Malheur
County last June, he went into the old placer-mining
region. He located a quartz mine there. He came home
in August, and went straight on to Portland to try to
interest some Eastern capitalists, who were there at that
time, in the mine. He succeeded. And, finally, in late
September, he got two big bugs to go down to Malheur
County with him to inspect the property.</p>

<p>They were coming out, on their way back to Portland
to draw up the papers and close the deal, when Uncle
Phineas heard what had happened here on Monday
night, October the eighth. He came straight home, as
you know. But he made an engagement to meet the men
in Portland, toward the end of the week. This is his reason
for going back to the city this last time. Everything
went through without a hitch. Uncle Phineas banked
the $45,000.</p>

<p>So, you see, all is smooth sailing from now on. With
that amount, we can bring the ranch through with flying
banners, or I am a fool. Yes, I know. But I am not a
fool where ranching, and nothing else, is concerned.
Though when I realize what Father could have done, if
he’d had half such an opportunity as this, it makes me
meek. Also, it makes me pretty sore at Uncle Phineas.
If it hadn’t been for his darn foolishness, I’d have had a
chance to know something, at least, about how Father
would have planned to go ahead with such an amount of
capital: how he would have expended it; saved it; what
mortgages he would have paid. As it is, I am in the dark
with a case of cold feet at the notion of so much money
to be handled.</p>

<p>On the square, Judy, I hated this doggone secrecy of
Uncle Phineas’s from the beginning. When he came
home last summer, he told me about the location of the
mine, what the ore had assayed, the accessibility to the
railroad and to water. It sounded so good that, in spite
of myself, and in spite of past experiences and even—shall
I say—in spite of Uncle Phineas, I had to believe
in the future of the thing.</p>

<p>I was strong for telling the rest of the family, or at
least some of the rest of them, right then. He would not
have it. He had used me as a safety valve, because he
had to confide or explode; but he would not tell another
soul. He insisted, rightly enough, on the difference
between locating a gold mine and getting a red cent out of
it. On the score of not building up the family’s hopes,
only to dash them, he did have a fair excuse for keeping
quiet and for requiring that I should. But I knew, and
he knew, that at any other time in the history of Q 2
Ranch, he would have come shouting in with the big
news, and allowed us all to have what fun we could out
of the hoping and planning—you know how it has always
been. No, sir, it was not fear of disappointing the
family that made Uncle Phineas swear me to secrecy.</p>

<p>It is a crumby thing to say, but, from the night she
came here, Uncle Phineas has hated Irene. He always
liked Chris better than he liked any of us, you know; so
a mixture of Mother, Beatrice, and Griselda would not
have satisfied him for his precious boy. Admittedly,
Irene possessed no such combination of perfections.
He was—and is, I suppose—convinced that Irene had
roped his cloyingly innocent nephew by foul means. He
thought all he had to do was to free Chris from the lasso
of propinquity, and then the infatuation would
instantly end. He tried to toll him off to Nome. When he
had to give over that plan, he decided that Irene, if she
saw no chance of getting away from Q 2 with Chris,
would pick up some day and leave without him. He
never for a moment believed that Chris would sell the
place. His point, all along, was to save Chris. Mine,
when I got mixed up with some mucky ideas of the same
sort, was to save the ranch.</p>

<p>Well, Uncle Phineas has saved the ranch. So I guess
it is rotten of me to start quibbling about his methods.
If he did make rather a bad mistake, he was more than
paid out for it by the fiddle-de-dee effect of his triumph
this evening. His announcement, with his display of the
bank book, was the forlornest victory I have ever
witnessed.</p>

<p>We are a sentimental herd, and there is no getting
away from it. When Uncle Phineas flashed the $45,000
on us, there wasn’t one of us, except Irene, I suppose,
who thought of anything but what that money, or a
tenth of it, would have meant to Father these last few
years.</p>

<p>He sprang it on us just after we’d sat down to supper.
We received it as we might have received an announcement
that he had had his photograph taken; and we
passed the bank book from hand to hand as we might
have passed the picture, though rather more quietly.</p>

<p>Of course, I had been more or less expecting it.
Though I was not prepared for any such sum as that.
He had told me he was going to hold out for $45,000;
but I had $15,000 fixed in my mind as the highest figure.
One does, you know, always divide by at least three
when it comes to Uncle Phineas and his affairs. Still,
since I had been primed, I don’t know why I should
have been so dumb. I might have sounded forth a glad
cry or two, it would seem, but I did not.</p>

<p>Lucy was the first to speak. She remarked: “Dear
me! An enormous amount of money. Money was
bothering all of us—wasn’t it—only a few weeks ago?”</p>

<p>Chris replied by shoving back his chair, rising, and
walking out of the room. Irene ran after him. Olympe
burst into real tears. Aunt Gracia ran to Grandfather
and put her arm around his shoulders.</p>

<p>“Don’t you understand, Father,” she said, “Uncle
Phineas has brought us a fortune? All our money worries
are over now. You must be glad, dear. You must be
glad!”</p>

<p>So take the “good news,” Judy. In spite of the neat
blue figures in the little leather book, I think none of us
has quite got hold of the idea as yet. Except—funny,
how often I have to make this exception—except, then,
Irene. She has got Chris at their packing already—but
a far from sunny, rather new Christopher, who snaps
at one, and is surly, and who says that he will pack, if
she likes her things put away in trunks, but that he is
not leaving Q 2 for a while.</p>

<p>Olympe is having a difficult time. She is torn between
remorse for having accused Uncle Phineas of iniquities,
widely assorted from neglect to infidelity, and anger at
him for having kept the secret from her for so long a time.</p>

<p>Poor Aunt Gracia seems to be in a trance. When you
consider how hard it is to think up excuses and decent
motives for mere mortals, you can imagine what a task
it must be to have to find them for Omnipotence. You
understand? If Father had to die, on the very night of
October eighth, death would have been so much easier
for him if he could have known that he was leaving us
all, and Q 2, safe. So, until Aunt Gracia’s faith
reconciles this seeming brutality with some obscure justice,
she is bound, I fear, to have a bad few days.</p>

<p>Grandfather has received the glad tidings by going
straight to his bed. Aunt Gracia seems seriously
concerned about him. But I know Grandfather, by this
time. After weathering the past twelve days, as he has,
he won’t allow what, after all, is good fortune, to down
him now.</p>

<p>Uncle Phineas put my name in the pot when he made
this deposit. In the future, I am to write checks with
the elders. I’ll celebrate by making my first one out to
you, and enclosing it in this letter. Thank the Lord you
can stop worrying about expenses. If you haven’t
plenty of room for Lucy, where you and Greg are now,
find a larger, more comfortable place. Or, if there is
anything at all that will make you happier—get it.</p>

<p><span class="sal">Dear Judy:</span>
Bless your heart for the letter that came
to-day. None of the folks see my hand in it. They are
all a bit worried, in spite of your denials, for fear Greg
may be not so well. But, to the last man, they are
relieved beyond measure at the prospect of getting Lucy
away from this damnable, suspicion-ridden hole that
used to be Q 2 Ranch, and safely with you.</p>

<p>It is being no end good for Lucy. The notion that
Judy-pudy needs her has chirked her chin up almost
to its erstwhile snobby slant. She drank milk at dinner
for the first time in ages. I knew why—strength for
efficiency. She is as busy as six bunnies getting her washing
done, and her clothes in order, and preparing
“presents” for you and Greg.</p>

<p>We’ll get her off on Thursday, I think. I’ll send you
full details about trains in a telegram on the day she
leaves here. For gosh sakes, Judy, don’t let there be
any slip up about meeting her. I hate like thunder to
have to allow the kid to make the trip alone. If Grandfather
were only in a little better shape, I’d bring her,
or Aunt Gracia might. If Chris and Irene had any
definite date for departure, we’d have her wait for them.
But, since Chris—and quite rightly—doesn’t care to
leave Q 2 until Grandfather is out of bed, I suppose
we’d better send Lucy along.</p>

<p>If, by Thursday, Grandfather should be up again as,
in spite of Dr. Joe’s pessimism, I rather think he may
be, I’ll hop the train and escort Lucy to Denver. Or,
if he seems well out of the woods, by to-morrow or the
next day, we may have Lucy wait and go with Chris
and Irene. Don’t worry, if I have to wire that she is
coming alone. I’ll make friends with the conductor,
and endow the porter.</p>

<p>Thank you, dear, for helping out.</p>

<p class="dateline">Wednesday, October 24, 1900.</p>

<p><span class="sal">Dear Judy:</span>
If I weren’t sure it would make things
worse instead of better, I should devote the first page
of this letter to an alphabetical classification of Neal
Quilter, beginning with ass, bounder, cad, dunce—it
is remarkably easy—and ending with wise-guy, yap,
and zany.</p>

<p>This, of course, as a direct result of your ten-page
letter, which came to-day, in answer to my letter about
the coroner’s inquest. The entire plan of writing to you,
as I did write, could have been conceived only by an
idiot—and the sound, fury, and significance have been
fittingly evinced.</p>

<p>Your attitude is the one reasonable attitude. I deserve
every bit of the big-sisterly sweetness, sympathy,
reassurance, and comfort that you are so determined to
lavish upon me. I deserve it all; but I am afraid that
I can’t endure much more of it. Jude, we have to cry
quits.</p>

<p>I do not, and I never did, suspect Aunt Gracia nor
Chris. Whatever brain storm I had, has passed. I
know, with no further need of reassurance, that I am
an innocent little lad. For gosh sakes, then, Jude—stop
it! I am not fool enough to ask you to forget what I
have written; but, if you can, forgive it; and, because
you must, ignore it.</p>

<p>In answer to your question, do as you think best
about telling Lucy that I have told you the truth. I
have no right, and no particular desire, to burden you
with keeping your knowledge a secret from Lucy. But
I certainly do advise that you girls think of the affair
as little as possible; that you two spend no time in
putting your heads together and puzzling. It is a
doggone unhealthy occupation, even for a man. The less
you kids think about it and talk about it, the better.</p>

<p>Dr. Joe—he came out again on Sunday—got word
to-day from Mr. Ward that the insurance people have
decided to fight our claim on the grounds of suicide.
They base their lying contention on the supposition
that the Quilters, unwilling to have a suicide in their
family, eager to collect, illegally, a large sum of money,
would have banded together to dispose of the weapon,
and to make the death seem to have been murder. Mr.
Ward wishes to fight it through to a finish. He says that
they are a rotten, one-horse, almost one-man, shyster
outfit, with no standing, and they should be shown up
and forced out of business. He says that the absence of
powder burns proves, conclusively, that the gun had
been fired from a distance of at least five or six feet.
Again, bother ropes, and masks, and coal oil, and
powder burns—or the lack of them. I know that
Father would not kill himself. I do not know how they
could tell whether or not there were powder burns,
underneath all that blood—— There I go again. Sorry.</p>

<p>What I began to say was, that this decision of the
company’s puts us in a nasty position. The Scylla of
allowing them to get away with their filthy claims,
and the Charybdis of dragging the thing through the
courts, and of seeming eager to make Father’s death a
paying proposition.</p>

<p>We’ll do nothing until Grandfather is able to give
us his best advice. At present, Dr. Joe and Uncle
Phineas are all for fighting the thing through. Chris is,
or seems to be, on the fence with Olympe and Irene;
Aunt Gracia and I are strong for dropping it, here and
now.</p>

<p>Grandfather is not coming along as well as I wish
he might. I think that it is mostly a general letting down
and relaxation, after shock. The money sort of gave him
an opportunity to rest. However, Grandfather is much
hurt because Uncle Phineas had not told him about the
mine, or asked his advice about any of the dealings.</p>

<p>Uncle Phineas tried to get square by explaining that
he was afraid Irene and Chris might have the same
ability he—Uncle Phineas—had for turning daydreams
into realities. In that case, had they known that a gold
mine was in the offing, they might have hied them to
New York on the strength of their knowledge.</p>

<p>This helped not at all. Grandfather inquired why
Uncle Phineas thought that he would go directly to
Irene and Christopher and inform them. He went on to
say that, in all his life, he had never betrayed a secret.
His voice fairly shook as he all but dared any one of
us to mention one instance of his having repeated the
most trivial thing that had been told him in confidence.
He said that, at eighty years of age, the discovery that
his own brother dared not trust him with a minor
confidence was an immitigably painful revelation. Sound
enough, sane enough, just enough; but from
Grandfather, at this time, rather thoroughly appalling.</p>

<p>Aside from Grandfather, the rest of us are doing fairly
well. The money assuages a lot. And the thought of
getting Lucy away from this hellish place is a comfort.
According to present plans, she is to leave to-morrow.
But you will have my telegram about that long before
you have this letter.</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p class="dateline">Thursday, October 25, 1900.</p>

<p><span class="sal">Dear Judy:</span>
I hope you won’t think that I am in the
throes of another brain storm, when you get the two
almost identical telegrams about Lucy’s departure and
arrival. After I had sent the first, I remembered the
time the telegram we sent to Chris had miscarried. So
I thought I’d play safe, and send another.</p>

<p>It was darn crumby business, starting Lucy off alone
on the train to-day. Nothing but the thought of
Grandfather, lying there in his darkened room at home, kept
me from hopping the train at the last minute and
going with her.</p>

<p>Grandfather is not pulling through as fast as I thought
he would. He was able to talk to me for a while this
morning, though Dr. Joe keeps time on us. Grandfather
asked me, straight, about the insurance. I told him
how things stood. He advised, strongly, that we drop
the claim. He said that no one, now, including the
insurance people themselves, believed for an instant that
Father’s death was a suicide. But, he said, by the time
we had aired the affair in court, and had allowed those
scoundrels to present their dishonest evidence, there
was no way of telling what some people might come to
believe. He said that Father’s honour needed no
defence, and that we would make none. He added that
no retort we could offer would carry the dignity of
non-retort.</p>

<p>I can hardly say how thankful I am for this decision
from Grandfather. To start yowling and yapping for
insurance money would seem to be the final, filthy
flourish. Thank the Lord that Uncle Phineas has made it
possible for us to drop it. Or, I guess, I should say that
Chris has made it possible for us to drop it.</p>

<p>After Grandfather and I had talked this morning,
he insisted upon seeing Chris this afternoon. Chris,
strangely, or naïvely, told me all this himself.
Grandfather put it up to him whether we should fight for
the insurance money or not. He said that, unless Chris
would give him his solemn promise that never again,
under any conditions, would he consider selling the
ranch, we should have to go to suit for the money.
Grandfather’s position was, that though now we are
in bonanza, if every few years we had to meet the same
proposition we had to meet when Chris came home
this spring, we’d need, and we should have to attempt
to get, every red cent we could put our hands on. Chris
promised like a shot. Judging from Chris’s account of
the interview, Grandfather made a very impressive,
almost but not quite Biblical ceremony of receiving
the promise.</p>

<p>So that is off our minds. Chris never would break a
promise. He’d have smashed us to bits by selling us
out; but he’d never so much as trifle with the pretty
knickknack of his own punctiliousness. I am darn glad
of it. Why I should be beefing about it, I don’t know.</p>

<p>This small check I am enclosing is to be used,
exclusively, for the funny little fleshpots you and Lucy
delight in. I fear I have been remiss about sending
messages to Greg; but I am certain that you have been
delivering, promptly, all the pleasant things I should
have said. I am better than that. I am certain that
Greg would know that I meant them, whether I had
sent them or not. I am a mucker with messages—but
you know how I feel about Greg.</p>

<p><span class="sal">Dear Judy:</span>
Thank you for the telegram that came
this evening. I went to Quilterville about five and hung
around over there for three hours waiting for it. If
people’s bumps of sympathy were developed in proportion
to their bumps of curiosity, living would be a more
tolerable project. Not, Lord knows, that I bid for
sympathy, or want it—that is, unless sympathy might be
expressed by decent silence.</p>

<p>No matter. It is great to know that Lucy is safe with
you. That, with the news of Greg’s improving health, is
the best bit I have had for many moons.</p>

<p>Grandfather seems about the same. I know that he
will come through all right; but Dr. Joe is worried. His
staying right on here proves that he is, more than
anything he says.</p>

<p>Tell Lucy I’d like a lot of letters from her, and long
ones, and that I shall not be critical. The place, with you
girls gone, is like a day with the morning missing. How
is that from your unpoetical, but most loving brother,</p>

<p><span class="sal">Dear Judy and Lucy:</span>
Aunt Gracia tells me that
you two are worrying because I have not written to you
since Grandfather’s death. I am sorry to have worried
you. I should have written.</p>

<p>We are all fairly well here. The weather is cold, but
sunny. Chris and Irene are leaving for New York
to-morrow.</p>

<p>If I can get Steve Roftus to take the job of running
the ranch for a year or two, I am planning to enter
Oregon Agricultural College in February. We know
that Steve is looking for a job, since Justin sold; but
whether we can get him for what we can pay, I don’t
know. We’ll go fairly high, because he is the best man
in the county, and, now, more than ever before, I feel
that I must have more adequate knowledge.</p>

<p>Getting Steve was Grandfather’s suggestion. I had
the last talk with him that anyone had. Two hours on
the night of the thirtieth. As I suppose the others have
told you, that was the night before he died. My best
regards to Greg.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>Lynn MacDonald’s reaching fingertips touched
smooth wood. She glanced at the page in her hand.
After all, it was the ending; fiction could scarcely have
improved upon it. What was it that Lucy had said in
one of her letters—something about life permitting
where literature refused? She returned the page in her
hand to its fraying creases and its envelope. “Poor
loving brother Neal,” she murmured, and shook her head,
and for a relaxing second drooped with a sigh.</p>

<p>She straightened, stood, jerking impatiently at
stiffness, walked across the room to her bookshelves, and
stooped to the row of fat encyclopedias. “Har to Hur,”
she pulled from the shelf, and added “Sai to Shu” to it.</p>

<p>A knock, demand nicely moderated by deference,
tapped on her door.</p>

<p>“Shall I have your car brought around, Miss
MacDonald, or shall I order your breakfast?”</p>

<p>“Sai to Shu” sprawled on the floor. Miss MacDonald
said: “Heavens on earth! What time is it?”</p>

<p>“It is seven o’clock, Miss MacDonald. I came early
this morning.”</p>

<p>“But, but,” stuttered the crime analyst, “the charwoman
hasn’t been in. She didn’t come in, last night.
I was going home whenever she came. How stupid!”</p>

<p>“I am sorry, Miss MacDonald. I met her as I was
leaving last evening, and warned her not to disturb
you.”</p>

<p>Miss Kingsbury, surely an intentionally impudent
fanfare of warm water, sudsy with soap and bath salts,
of pinking cold showers, of vigorous Turkish towels, of
stiff toothbrushes pungent with creamy paste, of tingling
scalps, of the benison of eye cups, of the rewards of
rest, sanity, and intelligent living, rescued “Sai to Shu”
from the floor.</p>

<p>“May I find something for you in this, Miss
MacDonald?”</p>

<p>“Put it in its place, if you will. I have finished with
it.”</p>

<p>“Har to Hur” stopped a gap in the shelves.</p>

<p>“And now, please, do telephone to the garage for my
car.”</p>

<p>Fingers, brisk with weariness, folded letters and
slipped them into tired old envelopes. Grapefruit,
coffee, bacon and eggs. Naughty Uncle Phineas; Olympe
with a lifted chin. A bath—first of all, a bath. Lovely
Aunt Gracia. Handsome Gibson man, Chris. Coffee,
and a crunching roll, and coffee. Your loving brother,
Neal. Poor supersentimentalist, fighting mere homely
sentiment—poor, loving brother Neal. Blue-eyed,
blonde and fuzzy Stanlaws lady. Love, and Lucy.
Pansy-faced children of Reginald Birch. A very warm
bath, and green bath salts. Grandfather. Pan——</p>

<p>“They are sending your car at once. May I help you
with these, Miss MacDonald?”</p>

<p>“Thank you. And lock them in the safe, if you will.”</p>

<p>A list of the notes she had begun to make in case,
toward the end, things should go astray.</p>

<ol>

  <li>Accident
  <p>Neal blamed.</p></li>

  <li>Richard <em>offers</em> to exchange rooms with Irene.
  <p>After accident.</p></li>

  <li>Baptism.</li>

  <li>Murder committed after missionaries and
      Chinaman had left the ranch.</li>

  <li>Dying words.
  <p>Red mask.</p></li>

  <li>Locked doors. Unlocked doors.
  <p>Keys under lamp.</p></li>

  <li>Rope.
  <p>Bed moved.</p></li>

  <li>Olympe’s revolver, .32 Colt’s.</li>

  <li>Revolver used for murder, .38 Colt’s.</li>

</ol>

<p>Absurd, all of it. She tore the paper into bits and
tossed them into her wastebasket.</p>

<p>“And now, please, Miss Kingsbury, get this hotel
on the telephone—here is the card—and make an
appointment for me with a Dr. Joseph Elm who is staying
there. This afternoon—let me see; yes, for three o’clock.”</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>Dr. Joseph Elm failed, wretchedly, with his attempt
to put a smile across the trouble of his face.</p>

<p>Lynn MacDonald insisted, “But the lady, Olympe,
is dead, Dr. Elm?”</p>

<p>He nodded at some woebegone thing a mile or two
away in the distance.</p>

<p>“Then, why won’t that do? Lucy worked it out very
cleverly. A .32 calibre Colt’s. A .38 calibre. You falsified
about the size of the bullet to save Olympe? No one will
remember. Yours was the only testimony concerning
the size of the bullet. It does leave us with the rope,
of course; but the rope may easily remain mysterious
in the light of your confession. Surely caring about this
thing as you care, you are not going to be thwarted
because of one helpful lie?”</p>

<p>Dr. Elm’s broad chest rose high, fell deep. “Look;
what do I care about a lie, one way or the other? I can
do it all right. Easy. Trouble is, when it comes to lies,
I’ve been kind of choosey about them. I can lie as well
as my neighbour; but I like to like my lies. There is
something about this one that—that kind of stirs my
fur. I don’t know. Olympe was a nice lady, and a good
friend of mine. Well, of course, if that’s the best we can
do, we’ll do it—or try to.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry, Dr. Elm, to disappoint you. That did
seem the most usable theory. But, since you dislike it
so much, let me think. A case against Irene——”</p>

<p>“No! Look. Irene’s alive—she’s got babies.”</p>

<p>“I meant, of course, merely that she should have got
rid of the gun, after suicide. But you won’t have that,
either—not suicide, of course. Olympe would do so
well—— But it has to be an outsider, is that it? The
snow is going to make it difficult, frightfully difficult,
to be convincing.”</p>

<p>“I was wondering, Miss MacDonald. Now suppose
you could come up with me to Q 2. We’d work you in
as a close, warm friend of Lucy’s. You said you’d like
to know her. The folks would be right glad to have you
as a guest. And money doesn’t matter to them; anything
you’d care to ask, they’d care to double——”</p>

<p>“No, Dr. Elm. There’d be no purpose in that. I can
think as well here in my office as I could think there.
I’ll do my best, I promise you. Perhaps I may have some
inspiration, later, about the outsider. After all, when
one tries, there is almost nothing that one can’t do
with circumstantial evidence, except to prove any
theory that is founded upon it.”</p>

<p>“I thought, maybe,” Dr. Elm persisted, “that the
folks at the ranch could give you some bits of evidence
that weren’t in the letters. Trouble is, I got another
wire from Judy this morning. I ’phoned her last night—but
she couldn’t talk. Neal isn’t getting any better.
Jehoshaphat, what wouldn’t I give for the truth!”</p>

<p>Lynn MacDonald’s pleasant features twisted. “The—truth!
But, Dr. Elm, you of all people know the truth.
You have read the letters.”</p>

<p>Dr. Elm merely grasped more tightly the arms of his
chair; but Lynn MacDonald drew back, and widened
her eyes and dipped her chin to a question.</p>

<p>“Look. We need a fresh start, my girl. A straight
one, this time. Do you mean to say that you know the
truth about who murdered Dick Quilter?”</p>

<p>“Dr. Elm, do you mean to sit there, glaring at me,
and tell me that you—you of all people on earth—don’t
know who killed Dick Quilter? Don’t know, and do need
me to tell you?”</p>

<p>“God bless my soul to glory! Are you trying to say
that you think I did it?”</p>

<p>Her laugh winged out, but its flight was short. “I am
sorry, Dr. Elm. Forgive me.”</p>

<p>“Certainly. Certainly. Don’t mention it. But when
you get all good and ready—— You see, I’m roasted
nicely; I’m all ready to turn, and take up and eat.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry. I——”</p>

<p>“Look. Do you know who murdered Dick Quilter?”</p>

<p>“I do, Dr. Elm. That is, I know it as well as anything
can be known that has not been accurately proved.
However, I think we can get the proof, the positive
proof, later.”</p>

<p>“Who did murder Dick Quilter?”</p>

<p>“Dr. Elm, since you really don’t know, and since I
have to tell you, I believe I would better begin at the
very start, if you don’t mind. For one thing, perhaps
your ignorance has taken a bit from my surety. Will
you answer a question or two for me, first?”</p>

<p>“Do you mean that Olympe Quilter really did
murder her nephew? By Gad, I don’t believe it!”</p>

<p>“See here, Dr. Elm. I told you that I thought I knew
the truth. I told you that I had no proofs. Now your
ignorance has changed certain aspects of the case. If
you will furnish me with the proofs I need—not all of
them, the end must come later, with a confession, but
with some of them—and if your proofs fit my theory,
I’ll tell you what I have decided. If your proofs should
happen to ruin my theory—I’ll not tell you. That is
positive, Dr. Elm. And, though you will hate me, you
should be grateful to me for it.</p>

<p>“Now then: Has Neal Quilter recently fallen in love?”</p>

<p>“Heavens, yes, if you want to know. And if three
years can be called recent. Fine, good, strong woman.
She loves him. He loves her. Plenty of money, plenty of
interests in common, plenty of time for babies, plenty
of everything, and nothing but this fool notion of
Neal’s is keeping them apart.”</p>

<p>“Good! Now, then: what was the nature of the
disease from which Richard Quilter was suffering?”</p>

<p>“You know, it said in the letters, chronic stomach
trouble.”</p>

<p>“Is that all you are willing to give me, Dr. Elm?”</p>

<p>“Look. Isn’t that enough? You’d think so, if you’d
ever had it.”</p>

<p>“You are asking for the truth from me, Dr. Elm.
And yet you won’t give it to me. Was Richard Quilter’s
trouble cancer? And did you promise him, because
of—what was it—‘ten generations of clean-bodied men
and women’ never to let any of his family know that
this was, or would have been, the cause of his death?”</p>

<p>“Adeno carcinoma of the liver. Lot of people thought
it could be inherited in those days. We didn’t want to
scare the children—that was it, chiefly: afraid of
marrying; afraid of babies. It was better untold.”</p>

<p>“Your autopsy, performed largely in the interest of
science, completely verified your original diagnosis,
Dr. Elm?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I was cold-blooded. We didn’t have the
X-rays in those days.”</p>

<p>“No, no. I understand. The medicine you gave him
contained a strong opiate of some sort, of course. Had
he taken any of it that night, or could you tell, from
the autopsy?”</p>

<p>“I could tell. He had not taken a drop of it.”</p>

<p>“Good. Now, then: about the footprints——”</p>

<p>“I don’t know one dang thing about any footprints.
I thought there weren’t any.”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t have said that. You see, the letters
made such a point of the absence of footprints that,
while I was reading, last night, I thought rather
fancifully to myself of the disclosures as footprints. Step
by step, almost from the first one of Lucy’s letters, the
whole thing was so absolutely evident, the intangible
footprints were so sure and so straight, that an
unimportant thing like actual footprints in the snow being
necessary for a solution seemed—well, perfectly
absurd.”</p>

<p>Dr. Elm said, “ ‘Sands of time.’ McGuffey, I guess.
All the poetry I ever knew I got from McGuffey, ‘Make
our lives sublime, and departing, leave behind us
footprints on the sands of time.’ ”</p>

<p>“Precisely,” said Lynn MacDonald.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Dr. Elm, “that’s over with. Who
murdered Dick Quilter?”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>A gray kitten batted the tip end of a fern flowing
green to the tiles of the sunroom’s floor, leaped
three feet, killed an inch of fringe on the rug, toppled
flat, waved coral set paws, and purred.</p>

<p>Dr. Elm snapped alluring fingers and said: “Puss?
Puss? Puss? Look, Judy, I didn’t think you’d take it
like this. I don’t think this is the right way for you
to take it, my girl.”</p>

<p>Judith loosed tightened lips to tremble words.
“Only—— I can’t believe it, Dr. Joe. I mean—— How
could Neal possibly have forgotten?”</p>

<p>“It is easier to say, maybe, how could Neal, being
Neal, possibly have remembered? Of course though,
Judy, we aren’t dead certain and can’t be, for a while,
that Neal did forget. That part of it was Miss
MacDonald’s one and only piece of guesswork. Jehoshaphat,
though, I hope she was right about it!”</p>

<p>“Yes. If she is right about—the other, I suppose we
have to hope for that, too.”</p>

<p>“She is right, Judy. There is no getting away from
what she called her footprints. They walk right through
the letters, making a path so plain it looks to me, now,
like nobody but a fool could have missed it. Lucy’s
second letter to you makes the first track. Maybe it
would take a crime analyst to discover it; but, in the
third letter, the path starts off, good and deep, and
follows straight along through Neal’s last letter to
you—not a misstep, not a detour, not a doubt. Soon as we can
find time, we’ll go through them, if you want to, and
trace them along. I thought I could tell you all the
points—but I must have missed some, if you aren’t
convinced.”</p>

<p>“I am. I have to be. Except—Neal’s forgetting.”</p>

<p>“Look, Judy. I don’t need to tell you about the
findings of modern psychology. You understand it better
than I do. But would you like to kind of whittle through
Neal’s case with me, the way Miss MacDonald explained
it—smart as a whip, that girl is—to kind of
refresh your memory and help you understand about
Neal?”</p>

<p>“I wish we might, Dr. Joe. You are wrong about my
understanding the new psychology. I don’t understand
it very well. I never have.”</p>

<p>“No; and who does? I shouldn’t have said ‘understand’—I
should have said ‘believe in,’ maybe, or some
such thing. We don’t understand gravitation, or love,
or sin, or electricity, or—much of anything. But we
believe in them because we’ve been forced to.</p>

<p>“Well, to begin with, Miss MacDonald says that
Neal is a supersentimentalist. That’s why he has
always fought sentimentality to the last ditch, and
derided it. He knew how extra-sentimental he was,
and he was ashamed of it; hated it like he’d have hated
a club-foot; inferiority complex right there, to use the
jargon, to begin with. What Neal should have done was
to have married real young, as Dick did. Then he’d
have had a nice conventional outlet for his floods of
sentiment—love of his wife and babies. That’s a lot
different from loving his aunties and uncles and sisters.
He didn’t marry. And, along in mid-adolescence, a
doggone unfortunate thing happened.</p>

<p>“He got the idea of marriage muddled up in his mind
with all the distress and fear and self-humiliation that
had ever come to him. Never had a worry in his life—I
mean a real, serious one—until Chris came home,
and the woman Chris had married started all the distress
about selling Q 2. Too sentimental, too loyal, to
blame Chris—or even Chris’s wife—blame it on marriage.
You know, Lucy quotes him as saying a blameless
young man and a pleasant girl married will make a curse
or a crime. Then, Chris and Irene were hugging and
kissing and loving and being as sentimental, here, there,
and everywhere, as they darned pleased. Neal was
jealous—though he didn’t know it, of course—so that
made him hate marriage (their liberty), and himself,
worse than ever.</p>

<p>“Look. Who let him out of his locked room that
night and directed him to Dick’s room, where he found
Dick killed? The woman Chris had married. Who made
a fool of him with her fake murder business? The woman
Phineas had married. Further back: What caused his
father to kill a man? (That went awful hard with Neal,
and I knew it, at the time.) The man your Aunt Gracia
was going to marry. Blame any of the folks? Same as I
said before—too loyal, too sentimental. Lots easier to
blame marriage. Marriage, you see this, Judy, mixed
up with the dark experiences of his life; mixed up with
murder, grief, despair, fear, self-disgust. Look—a firm
resolve never to have any truck with marriage. Or, if
you like it better, a marriage complex. About as easy
for a loving, sentimental lad like Neal to endure, as
a boil on the end of his nose.</p>

<p>“It didn’t look so pretty, and he knew it. He stopped
talking about it, soon as he got a little older, and
hoped folks wouldn’t notice it. Before long, he stopped
looking cross-eyed, so’s he could see it himself. He
began to look—well, crooked, out of the sides of his eyes
so’s he couldn’t see it at all. Got the habit of looking
crooked. Forgot the boil; and it was a relief, you can
bet on that. Here I am, though—that’s what always
happens to me when I try to do fancy work with my
words—with a boil on Neal’s nose, when I want a
complex against marriage stored away in his mind’s dark
chambers and forgotten. Stowed right next on the shelf
to the secret he had to keep; the secret that smashed his
life to chips for a while—the secret he’d like to forget,
but couldn’t. So far so good, Judy?”</p>

<p>“Yes——”</p>

<p>“So far so bad would be more like it, I guess. Well,
here on the ranch, giving his heart to it, giving his
energy and his time to it, having you Quilter women
to compare with the women he met, making them look
pretty small, Neal didn’t have much of a fight with
this marriage complex until Mrs. Ursula Thornton
showed up. (Maybe I should have told you that Miss
MacDonald went at all this a little differently from what
I have. She began this analysis of Neal and his
complexes about sixteen or seventeen years farther back
than I have. Freud, you know. But that always seemed
like drawing a pretty long bow, to me.) Anyway,
Ursula wasn’t so much unlike your mother, Judy, nor so
much unlike you girls. She came about as close to being
a Quilter as she could come without having been born
into the family: beautiful, smart, good—all the
attributes. Neal loved her on the dot. She loved him. No
use beating around the bush—that’s what happened.</p>

<p>“Fine and dandy? Look; not so you could notice.
Here comes the marriage complex. Let’s turn it into
the boil again on the end of his nose. Neal can’t see it
any longer. Eyes are set for looking crooked, the other
way. Neal has plumb forgot he had it. What’s the trouble
then? It’s still there—that’s the trouble. It’s been
there, all these years, growing bigger and meaner all
the time.</p>

<p>“Marriage means to Neal, by this time, murder,
disgrace, terror, humiliation. Will he accept it? He will
not. Who would? Will he get around it? He will, if he
can. Will he admit that he doesn’t want to marry the
woman he loves? Lord bless us—he can’t. He doesn’t
know it. You can’t admit something you don’t know.
What’s he going to do, then?”</p>

<p>Judith said: “Make a substitution. Put an unreal
reason for his refusal to marry in the place of the real
reason?”</p>

<p>“That’s it. Next job for Neal is to find the substitute.
Substitutes, in cases of this kind, aren’t always so
doggone easy to find. Neal had his, right at hand. All
he needed to do was to tinker it some, and it was in
good shape for use. I mean the secret that had been
burdening him, torturing the living soul out of him for
years. He didn’t want that secret, Judy. He never had
wanted it. Look, here’s what happened.</p>

<p>“Up bobs Mr. Modern Devil, alias repressions, and
just as sly and wicked as the old-fashioned red one with
horns and a tail. Up he comes from modern hell, our
subconscious minds—just as black and rotten a region
as the old brimstone-and-fire affair—and he says,
‘Leave it to me.’</p>

<p>“ ‘That secret,’ says Mr. Modern Devil, ‘isn’t any use
to us. Turn it into a reason for your not marrying,
and make it of some account.’</p>

<p>“Easy enough for Neal to do. He’d had the idea
in his mind, anyway, since 1900. Look. Here we have
it. ‘A man who murdered his own father is not fit to
marry. I murdered my own father. I am not fit to
marry.’ Slick? Good reason for avoiding marriage. And,
Neal being Neal, the supersentimentalist, the secret
revised into a form that seems, anyhow, a little easier
to bear.</p>

<p>“Just one thing is the matter now. It is a nasty,
poisonous mess, this work of Neal’s personal devil.
A sane mind can’t function with a mess of that kind in
it, any more than a healthy stomach could function,
properly, with a dish of poisonous toadstools in its
middle. But, thank the Lord—or, maybe, Miss
MacDonald—we’ve got the antidote to feed Neal: The
truth.”</p>

<p>“He won’t take it, Dr. Joe. He scorns, hates modern
psychology.”</p>

<p>“Sure he does. Why wouldn’t he? He’s afraid of
it—scared to death of it.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know. But, if he won’t take it, what are we
going to do?”</p>

<p>“Remember how the ads used to read in pre-prohibition
days? ‘A few drops in his coffee. Taste not detectable.’
Look, Judy. I mean we can tell Neal the truth
without labelling it psychology, can’t we? The truth is
all he needs. Truth, in these cases, is the catharsis—the
cure. Miss MacDonald kind of held out for an absolute
verbal acknowledgment. She says that will be by a long
shot the best. But I know, darn well, that, even if we
can’t get the acknowledgment from him in words, it
will be all right if we can get him to make it to himself.
Yes, and there’s a lot of stuff about reëducation after
freeing the repression. But I’ll bet you that, if Neal
has the truth, Ursula will do for the reëducation.</p>

<p>“Look, though, Judy. We’ll have to be real delicate
about feeding him the truth. I’d suggest sort of oozing
it into him. We don’t want to gag him with it, and
choke him to death. I told Miss MacDonald not to
worry about that for a minute. Tact, I told her, was
your middle name. I knew you could manage it fine.”</p>

<p>“I?”—a mouse of a word, caught in a trap and
squeaking.</p>

<p>“How do you mean, Judy?”</p>

<p>“Dr. Joe, dear Dr. Joe—I can’t. Won’t you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, now, bless my soul to glory, Judy——”</p>

<p>“Please, Dr. Joe? You’re a man, you’re——”</p>

<p>“Hold on there, Judy! Yes? Look. Just about a
minute you’d have been talking baby talk, or worse, if
I hadn’t stopped you. I never trust a woman when
she starts by telling me I’m a man. Flatterer. No, but,
Judy, I’ll try this, if you want me to. Sure I will. I think
you’d do it better than I would; but, if you don’t think
so, I’ll try—— Hezekiah and the egg, you know.”</p>

<p>“Dr. Joe— Dr. Joe, you’re—you’re——”</p>

<p>“Don’t say it, Judy. Don’t you do it.”</p>

<p>“Divine.”</p>

<p>“All right. Just for that, now, I’m going to send
you a bill.”</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>Dr. Elm gave a stiffening shake to the newspaper,
and reread the recipe for hot-water pie crust. The clock
on the mantel spun three cool, silver threads, and a
black and red spark from the fire beneath them spit
out on the polished floor. Dr. Elm rose, kicked the
spark to the hearth, fumbled in his pocket for a cigar,
bit the end of it, and returned it to his pocket.</p>

<p>“ ’Lo, Neal.”</p>

<p>“Hel‑lo, Dr. Joe! This is fine. I didn’t know you’d
come. Judy just now ’phoned down to me, and I rode
right up. Great to see you here again. Did you have a
pleasant trip to San Francisco?”</p>

<p>“No. Not so very. I went for my health, you know.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know! What’s the trouble, man?”</p>

<p>“I’m getting along, Neal. Getting pretty old. I’ve
been thinking, here lately, that I’ll likely be shuffling
along and out of here before many months.”</p>

<p>“Rubbish, Dr. Joe! You’re fit as a fiddle. How come?”</p>

<p>Dr. Elm returned to the wing chair and sank heavily
into it with a slow, showy sigh. Neal curved an arm
on the mantel and frowned at the fire.</p>

<p>“Sit down, boy. You’ll burn your clothes—that fire
is popping like corn. Besides, if you can spare me a few
minutes, I’d like to have a little talk with you. I’ve got
to ask kind of a favour of you, Neal. I hate it worse
than hell—but I can’t see any way out of it.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you bet. But you couldn’t ask a favour of me,
Dr. Joe—not to save your life. Anything I could do
for you would be a favour to me, and you know it. So
cut the favour stuff, and go ahead from there.”</p>

<p>“That’s nice of you, Neal. I certainly appreciate it
a lot. But—— Well, no matter now. Anything I’ve got
to say will hold over all right. Kind of a shame to
bother you—— I expect you’d like to hear about my
trip? We’ll let the other ride, for the present——”</p>

<p>“Dr. Joe! For the love of Pete, what did I say? See
here, man—put it any way you care to put it. But, for
God’s sake, if I can help you——”</p>

<p>“That’s all right. That’s all right, boy. You didn’t
say anything. No—just changed my old fool mind,
that’s all.”</p>

<p>“But you can’t do it, Dr. Joe. You can’t get away
with it—not with me. What is it? Money? You’ve attended
this entire family for half a century, and you’ve
never seen the colour of Quilter money yet——”</p>

<p>“No, no, Neal. Not money. No, it’s more serious than
that. Funny, how precious our old, miserable, tag-end
years get to us, when we feel the last of them
approaching.”</p>

<p>“See here, Dr. Joe. You’re the best friend I have on
earth—the best friend any Quilter has. Now, a minute
ago, you began to tell me what I could do—what you’d
allow me to do. Then I made some cursed, damn-fool
break and spoiled it all. I’m not going to sleep to-night
until you and I get this thing straight.”</p>

<p>“No, Neal, you didn’t make any break. I just looked
at you, and I thought you didn’t look so well yourself.
And this—this request of mine wasn’t going to be pleasant
for you, boy. I just thought I’d better let up on it,
maybe, till you got a little more fit yourself. Look. It
will keep——”</p>

<p>“Not on your life it won’t keep. I was never sounder
than I am right now. Of course, I’ve been a little
worried here of late—one thing and another, you know how
it goes—but physically I’m as tough and healthy as a
Q 2 heifer.”</p>

<p>“That’s what I meant, Neal. I thought you looked
kind of worried, or something. No time to be
bothering you with my troubles——”</p>

<p>“Only that I suppose the knowledge that you are in
trouble, and that you won’t give me a chance to help
you—if I could—would be a more serious trouble,
worry, than any other I could have.”</p>

<p>“Well, of course, if you put it that way, Neal. Look.
What do you know about this new-fangled psychology
stuff?”</p>

<p>“Not a doggone thing. And I’d like to know less.
Chris shoves it at me, now and then: conscious,
subconscious, complexes, dreams. Dreams, if you please.
Rot, all of it, from beginning to end!”</p>

<p>“Yes? Well, I expect you’re right. It always had a
phoney sound to me. But what I was wondering about
it, was this: Could worry, kind of linked up with a
guilty conscience, just sort of get the best of a man of
my age? That’s the way I feel, boy. Bless my soul to
glory, I feel like if I couldn’t rid myself of this eternal
load of worry, get things straightened out for myself,
and get away from under it, I feel like it would pound
me right down into my grave. I can’t sleep any more.
I can’t eat. I can’t get anything out of a good cigar. I
thought maybe a trip away would fix me up a little. Got
worse. Just now, Neal, you said I couldn’t ask a favour
of you to save my life. Well, that’s about what I’m
doing. Look. I’m asking this favour, hoping that it will
give me a new lease on life. I wouldn’t ask you, Neal, if
I knew anyone else on God’s green footstool to ask——”</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t? Well, if you say it, I guess I deserve it.”</p>

<p>“No, no. You got me wrong there. I’d sooner ask help
of you than of any other living man, except—about this
one thing. It is the most painful thing in your life, boy.
That’s the damn trouble about bringing it up to you.”</p>

<p>“You must mean, then, that it has something to
do with—1900.”</p>

<p>“That’s about the size of it, Neal. I killed Dick.”</p>

<p>“That’s a damn lie! And you know it!”</p>

<p>“Take it easy, boy, if you can. I’m sorry. I knew I
shouldn’t unburden on you. We’ll drop it. Let well
enough alone. Pull the bell there, will you? I’d like a glass
of water. I get these kind of rushing, dizzy spells———”</p>

<p>“Dr. Joe, listen. I——”</p>

<p>“That’s all right, boy. I knew better than to tell you,
but——”</p>

<p>“In the name of God, where did you get this mad
idea? You weren’t here on the ranch. You were in
Portland, more than two hundred miles away.”</p>

<p>“That’s what I said at the time. I had to say it.
Neal, listen a minute, if you can, before you jump down
my throat. It wasn’t cold-blooded murder. It was——I
did it for Dick. I did it because he begged and prayed
me to. I did it because he threatened, a threat he meant
to keep and I knew it, that if I wouldn’t do it for him,
he’d ask—well, somebody else, who would.”</p>

<p>Neal said, “A pitcher of water, please,” to two
white-trousered legs, and they vanished.</p>

<p>“You see, my boy, your father’s ailment was cancer.
He knew it, and I knew it. He took my promise not to
tell. When he was shot, he had maybe three months of
life ahead of him—maybe not so long. Three months
of slow agony. He wasn’t afraid of them. No. He was
afraid of losing Q 2 for his family and his children and
their children. He wouldn’t have been afraid of that,
either—not the way he was afraid—if he had been
going to live to see you all through. But he wasn’t
going to live; and there were old people, and his sister,
and his three children and an invalid boy all going to
be left to shift for themselves, and nothing to shift with.
He gave into Chris about selling, not because of any
false pride—never knew a Quilter yet who had an
ounce of it—but because he knew he wouldn’t be alive
another six months to keep Chris from selling. Chris
was a good boy, and he’s been getting better ever
since; but, right then, anybody with a lick of sense knew
that it was a question of now or later with Chris. Dick
knew; but he had to be certain sure of it. You’re right,
this weather is——”</p>

<p>Neal said, “All right, Gee Sing. Thanks. Skip.”</p>

<p>“Yes, as I was saying, Dick needed to know, and
he found out—if Chris didn’t sell in October, he’d sell
in December.</p>

<p>“Now your father, Neal, was your grandfather’s
own son. He’d been brought up on your grandfather’s
philosophy. Schiller, you know, and his realistic
pantheism; his insistence on sacrificing the individual to
the species. (Seems to me that I remember your
grandfather was making a new translation of Schiller, just
about that time.) And Hume, with his insistence that
no act that was useful could possibly be criminal. Dick
believed these principles with all his soul. His death,
by accident, would be useful—damn useful. It would
give his folks money to hold on to Q 2, and to provide,
not only for them, but for all future generations of
Quilters. If Chris had sold Q 2 in 1900, he’d have sold a
lot more than the ranch. Some of the folks here said
that, at the time. Dick hated like thunder to think of
the old people in poverty; he hated to think of you as a
farm hand; of Greg and Judy having to surrender
in Colorado; of Lucy’s genius winding up by ringing a
school bell at nine every morning.</p>

<p>“These, and other things—including whether or not
the Quilter family was worth saving—were the things
he had to balance against cheating an insurance
company that had cheated him. (He didn’t balance his
death. He was dying, and a quick, easy death was a
mercy and a blessing.) Greatest good for the greatest
number—that weighed heavily. It was a shyster company,
cheating right and left, wherever it could. Dick
decided to sacrifice the company’s exchequer—you know
how impersonal companies seem—to the good of the
species, Quilter.</p>

<p>“Of course I know that some men would rather see
their families sink into want, would rather die a
lingering, suffering death and leave their old folks on the
grater of poverty, and their children’s futures
unprovided for, than to work a graft on a darn rotten
insurance company. Some men would. I don’t honestly
know whether or not I’m glad that Dick, Thaddeus
Quilter’s son, wouldn’t. But it is true, anyway. He
wouldn’t. And he believed, ‘No act that is useful can
possibly be criminal.’</p>

<p>“Thinking the thing over and over, as I have, sometimes
I’ve wondered if the old gentleman could, maybe,
have anyway guessed the truth. You know how fine
and flip he kept up through it all. Olympe’s fake play
bowled him over, for a few minutes, but he was up
again and at it within the hour. Right at the head of
things, managing, like he always had. Yes, fine and flip
until your Uncle Phineas came home with the money
for the mine. Took to his bed that night, and never got
up again. It almost seemed as if that was what knocked
him out—the uselessness of Dick’s and my planning; the
uselessness of what we’d done. Like the uselessness of it,
maybe, had turned it into a crime.</p>

<p>“Planning? We certainly planned. Yes, but here I’m
putting myself into it too soon. Before he ever said a
word to me about it, Dick tried to arrange an accidental
death for himself. You remember—when the wagon
tongue broke while he was driving a skittish team over
Quilter Mountain? Scared the living pie out of him
when he got home and found that, if he had succeeded,
you’d been blamed and would have blamed yourself
to your dying day. He made up his mind, then and there,
that he’d play safe with the next attempt. It wasn’t
as easy to do as you might think. Drowning, for instance?
Suicide for sure. No, he had to have it fixed so
that the death could be proved, positively, to have been
accidental. Neal? Neal, my boy, are you listening to
me?”</p>

<p>“I’m listening.”</p>

<p>“Excuse me. I kind of thought you’d dropped off
to sleep, or something. Mind if I keep along with the
story? Well, after the Quilter Mountain accident, Dick
found, too, how your Aunt Gracia was going to feel
about his dying in sin—or not in a state of grace, I
guess she put it. He knew that a sudden shocking death
was going to be pretty hard on the family for a while.
If he could make it even a mite easier for any one of you,
he was going to do it. He did. Went and got himself
baptized as a Siloamite. You know, without my telling
you, what that meant to your auntie, especially those
last weeks before she died.</p>

<p>“Well, Dick planned alone, and we planned together.
By Gad, Neal, but we tried. We thought that we had
everything fixed slick from beginning to end. Every
single member of the family locked tight in their rooms.
Dick got the keys that afternoon, and did the locking
himself that night. (Damn hard luck about Irene being
locked out. Jehoshaphat, but that was a bad one!) He
left all the other doors in the house unlocked to make
getting in and out seem easy. But he thought that the
rope was the best bet of all to prove an outsider. Dick
fixed the rope himself, and moved the bed, so’s it would
look for certain that the criminal had got out of the
window, down the rope and clean away.</p>

<p>“He thought that Chris would climb out of the
window in his room, sooner or later, and come along the
roof, and get into his room and see the keys—Dick had
put them there in plain sight—and let the others out of
their locked rooms.</p>

<p>“When Irene, instead of Chris, came running into his
room, Dick used his last breath to save me—and the
family. He looked toward the open window and said, or
tried to, that a man wearing a red mask had got away.
I’ve wondered how he happened to say red. Maybe the
colour on his nightshirt made him think of it. Maybe he
thought some poor devil might be found with a black
mask—but a red mask never would be found. I don’t
know.</p>

<p>“You see, boy, how it was? Planned and planned for,
everything fixed. And then the damn snow came and
ruined it all, ruined the whole works from beginning to
end. First time in a quarter century that Quilter County
had had snow in October. Snow isn’t noisy. Dick in his
bed, I in my hiding place—we had no notion of the
snow. We’d planned it all for earlier, too; but Dick
would have it that we wait until the missionaries and
Dong Lee were out of the house. Suspicion wouldn’t
touch a Quilter. But a religious fanatic, or a Chinaman,
they’d be something else again.</p>

<p>“That’s the end of it, I guess, Neal. No matter,
much, about things from then on. This is what is killing
me, boy. That all these years I’ve been coming a
coward and a hypocrite among you folks, taking your
friendship, and all that, and never daring to own up.
Of course, I’m bound to stick up for myself and say that,
sometimes, it still seems to me that I didn’t do such an
awful thing. It was hard, Neal—it was damn, damn hard;
but Dick begged and prayed me to. And, of course, as
the movies say, I’ve paid. Yes, I’ve paid—paid through
the teeth. And now, when I’m getting old——”</p>

<p>“Dr. Joe, would you mind a lot, just—keeping still
for a minute or two? Sorry. I’ve got to think. I’ve got to
think.”</p>

<p>In the hall a door banged, and an oak log in the fire
broke down into its coals. A rill of laughter came
coursing through the room, pursued by a little girl with
red cheeks and a green frock. She caught her step and
dipped to a courtesy. “How-do-you-do, Dr. Joe? I
didn’t know that you were here. I’m very glad to see
you. I was looking for Mother, Uncle Neal.”</p>

<p>Neal said, “I haven’t seen Lucy for two hours.”</p>

<p>“It is rather important. Baby Thad keeps saying,
‘Wee’ and it sounds as if he were speaking French.”</p>

<p>Dr. Elm said, “Have you told your father?”</p>

<p>“Father is engrossed, enraptured. It was he who sent
me for Mother. Oh, there’s Christopher, home from
Quilterville so soon. Coo‑ee—— Chris?”</p>

<p>A sleek, yellow-haired boy parted the curtains.
“What-ho, child? Why, how-do-you-do, Dr. Joe? Glad
to see you. Did you drive over in your new Chaptler?
Dad is going to give me a sport model Ford for my
birthday. I’ve left off smoking. Makes me hungry all the
time. If you’ll excuse me, I think I’ll raid the kitchen.
You’re invited, Delidah. Coming?”</p>

<p>“By Gad, Neal,” Dr. Elm said, when another door
had trapped the chatter and the laughter, “I can’t
even enjoy the kids, any more. It is killing me, and I
wish it would—if it would make haste about it. I can’t
eat. I can’t sleep——”</p>

<p>“Wait a minute. Shall we go up to my room? Would
you as soon? It’s more private there. I—— I’ve
something to tell you, Dr. Joe. Explain. Shall we go up?”</p>

<p>The hall was full of sunshine. Out from the living
room, the first bars of Schumann’s <i>Abendlied</i> came
softly, but with certainty.</p>

<p>Neal paused for a moment on the stairway. “That’s
Judy,” he said. “She plays Schumann well. Ursula
plays him better.”</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>Dr. Elm pressed his elbows into the table and rubbed
his smooth pink baldness in the palms of his hands. He
said: “That’s good of you, Neal. It’s mighty good of
you, and I appreciate it. But, of course, you couldn’t
expect me to believe that I’d up and—forget, or whatever
you call it, about the most tragic experience of my
life. No. Men lie to themselves; but they lie in their own
favour. They don’t make mistakes, as you’ve been
saying—not about whether or not they killed a friend.”</p>

<p>“Listen, man! I’ve listened to you. You’ve got to
listen to me. Yes, you’ve got to do a damn sight more
than listen. You’ve got to believe me. I know. And I’ll
tell you how I know.</p>

<p>“In a way it makes it more incredible; but, get this,
Dr. Joe, I’m under oath. I’m telling you God’s own
truth. I am swearing to you that, for the past two years
or more, until about half an hour ago—somewhere
along in your talk to me—I have thought exactly the
same thing about myself. I am swearing to you, Dr.
Joe—swearing, remember—that I’ve done what you’ve
done, and what you declare it is impossible for men to
do. I have forgotten; that is, I’ve got things all twisted.
I thought, and I believed—as you believe about yourself—that
I killed Father; I myself. If it is necessary, to
convince you, I’ll drag Judy into this. I’d rather not;
but I will, to get you straightened out. I told Judy, here
about two weeks ago, that I had killed Father.”</p>

<p>“Now, now, Neal. You and Judy——”</p>

<p>“Damn it! I’m not a liar. We won’t get any place if
you keep this up. I’ve known for years that my mind
and my senses played tricks on me. You must have had
similar experiences? Try to remember. Haven’t you
been fooled, by yourself, before this, on less important
matters?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Yes, I have. I imagine most men have. But
that’s everyday, come-along business.”</p>

<p>“Maybe. Maybe not. I know this. My case was a lot
worse than yours is. I had had all the facts, the same as
you had them, and from the same source—I’m positive
of that. You remembered most of the facts. I had forgotten
every last one of them. I’d forgotten that Father
planned his own death. I was in a lot worse condition
than yours, because I’d got so addled that I thought I
stepped into Father’s room that night and shot
him—just as any other brute of a murderer might have
done—to gain something for myself. I’d forgotten that Father
had cancer. I’d forgotten every damn thing, but that
Monday night and Irene—with blood on her wrapper.</p>

<p>“Do I know how to sympathize with you? Say! Do I?
I’ve been living in hell here, for the last few years. I’ve
been getting worse all the time. Lord, but it’s queer—the
things men’s minds will do! Night after night I’ve
walked this floor fighting suicide. You remembered the
extenuations. I forgot every damn thing. If this hadn’t
come up to-day—I don’t know. I was about as near
crazy as a man could get, and stay sane.”</p>

<p>Dr. Elm puffed out a long-drawn breath. “Hot,” he
said, “up here. Too hot. Bless my soul to glory if I can
understand you, Neal. You thought you’d done it, you
say, until I told you that I had. Look. Now you seem
to be saying that you know I didn’t. No. No, you’re too
deep for me.”</p>

<p>“I thought I had done it—I’m a fool with words—I
thought I had done it until you talked to me. Until I
heard you explaining—much as I had had it explained
to me twenty-eight years ago. I could hear the very
words I had heard before; see the gestures; feel the—horror?
shock? Well, whatever I felt, then, it was pretty
bad. Word for word this afternoon, all of it over again:
Father’s illness; his plan to save the ranch and the family;
his accident; the change of rooms on account of distance;
his baptism; the waiting for the missionaries to
leave—— I’d heard it all before, Dr. Joe, as you’d heard
it and at about the same time, twenty-eight years ago.
The rope to mislead us. All of us locked in our rooms.
The mistake about Irene. And then—I guess the real
tragedy—the snow. Good God, what the sight of that
impossible October snow must have meant! How, in
the name of suffering, could I have forgotten? How
could I have heard it all explained—and forgotten it!
But I did. I had. That’s that. And so have you.”</p>

<p>“Look, Neal. I’m wondering whether there could be
something in this new psychology, after all? If we could
dig the explanations of our tricky minds, as you say,
out of it, maybe?”</p>

<p>“Lord, no! Nothing like that. It is altogether
different—sexy stuff, dreams, gosh knows what all; offensive
and silly. No, this is plain common sense. All this
amounts to, I guess, is a lapse of memory. The strangest
part of it is that both of us, you and I, should have had
the same lapse—brain storm used to be the word. But
we have had it—that’s evident. And, again, that’s that.
After all, it is another proof of how even the best friends
can be strangers. Here we’ve been, living in hells of our
own devising, when any time in the past years, if we’d
got together and talked, we’d probably have set each
other free—got the truth, as we have to-day.</p>

<p>“You mean—— You think you have the truth,
Neal?”</p>

<p>“Think? I know I have. Gosh, I can’t get over it.
Queerest experience I have ever heard of a man having.
And then, on top of that, discovering that my best
friend has had exactly the same experience.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean, when you say you have the truth,
that you know who killed Dick? You say you know I
didn’t do it. All right. If I didn’t do it, who did?”</p>

<p>“Look at it this way. Father made his plan. He
needed help. He had to have sure, competent help.
He needed a cool head and a steady hand. He needed a
pile of courage—before and after. He needed
self-command and discretion. He needed someone who was
willing to sacrifice his peace of mind for all his remaining
years, and to sacrifice a problematical eternity, for the
sake of the Quilter family He needed all the virtues, and
one small saving grace of sin. Who, then, would he have
told of his cancer, and have turned to for his help?”</p>

<p>“Your Aunt Gracia?”</p>

<p>“No. I hoped you’d see it. You haven’t? That puts
it up to me. He’d want me to tell you. He wasn’t afraid
to load his gun and carry it next door into Father’s
room that night and—back again to his own room. He
wasn’t afraid, at the end, to tell me. I mean, Dr.
Joe—Grandfather.”</p>

Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div><div>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div><div>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div><div>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div><div>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div><div>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
</div><div>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div><div>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div><div>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
